# Average Joe
## Chapter 4

The phone hung up and McCarthy threw it to his passenger seat. He was quiet as if contemplating what he was about to do. 

“Just be quiet boy. I don’t want to do this but I can’t say no to the money. I just can’t.”  McCarthy said with a wavering voice. 

I thought about screaming and kicking at everything in sight. I really did but I really couldn’t. I had to hope that McCarthy was taking me to the police station and I knew if I released my rage like I wanted to that I would only get myself into more trouble. Besides, my heart was beating so hard that I didn’t think it could keep up with it’s frenetic pace. I had to try and relax. Try to think. 

“But Why?” I sobbed. Desperation now clearly visible on my face and audible in my voice. 

No response.

We pulled off the highway not 5 minutes later as originally promised. The building was rather large and in the shape of a castle. There was a moat out front, a lowered drawbridge and a tower that one might find at Disney land where the damsel in distress might be found. There were a ton of cars in the parking lot but we went around back where there were quite a bit of men in suits situated around the doors. 3 black escalades, a few black limousines and a cop car at both the front and rear of the caravan both with lights flashing. If I hadn’t known any better I would’ve thought the President was here.

I let out a sigh of relief after seeing the cop cars. Like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I was ok letting the legal process play out, I wasn’t ok with being sold off to the highest bidder. 

“Don’t get too excited kid, he owns the cops. They work for him on the side and they make a salary’s worth of pay doing odd and ends job a few times a year then they do a whole year doing honest work.” McCarthy said. 

I sighed a long drawn out breathe.  “Who is ‘he’ and what does he want with me? Why are you doing this?”. 

“I dunno what he wants with you, but there is a large price on offering you up and I have bills to pay. Don’t take this personally, it’s just business.” said McCarthy looking into the rear view mirror. 

My head lowered and I closed my eyes. All of the thoughts of the day rushing back into my mind. My hands were still behind my back but I thought of the blood beneath my fingernails. Maybe he thought I killed someone? Maybe he thought I hurt someone? I don’t know but I didn’t like the feeling of not stating my piece. 

“I’m not sure what you think you know about me, but I haven’t hurt anybody. The blood under my nails, while I can’t explain it, I promise I haven’t hurt anybody. Weird things happens to me in my sleep that I can’t explain. I re-arrange future. I clean my house. I wrestle with lamps. I do all kinds of crazy and stupid unexplainable things. I’d never hurt anybody McCarthy. I know it doesn’t change my current situation, but I just wanted to clear my conscious.” The words coming out of my mouth as if someone stole my lunch money. For some reason though I wasn’t scared of McCarthy. I wasn’t fearing for my life anymore, at least not at this moment. This seemed to be just business for McCarthy and while I couldn’t understand how an officer of the law could do such a thing, I could understand him getting paid. Ten thousand dollars was a lot of money. It could buy quite a bit of peace and mind and I could respect that. I was still afraid of what was going to happen but for the moment I was in positive state of mind. Things _had_ to start looking up. This too shall pass and a bunch of other cliches entered my thoughts.  

“I figured as much boy”. McCarthy said matter of factly. “Looking at your calf it seemed to match like you’d scratched it too hard. Probably happened in your sleep. That’s what made me realize it was you who they were after. You fit the description”.

I looked down at my legs and my left calf had deep red cuts on it. Five of them in total and I mentally imagined my had over the wounds and it seemed to have matched up. With all of the commotion that had taken place today I guess I didn’t really notice it. It didn’t need stitches but they were deep cuts and they were still raw. Of course, when I saw them and the sweat running over them they started to burn. 

I chuckled halfheartedly as I thought back to all the times I had accidentally hurt myself in my sleep. I’ve fallen down stairs, slammed my finger in my car door and stubbed my toes too many times to count. As if I was hulk I’d lift my bed over my head only to realize it was too heavy to sustain and drop it on my toes. Tear up my fingers in the process too. “I suppose this isn’t the first time I’ve done crazy things to myself.” I said aloud talking to only myself. 

I had recognized the establishment. I had been here on a few dates actually. I had never seen the back like this though. There was only one way in and one way out with a little security hut near the entrance and exit. Two men in suites were sitting inside with guns holstered under their arms. McCarthy rolled down the window and one of the men peered inside seemingly staring at McCarthy’s badge, then the other in the backseat towards me. 

“Is that” the man in the suite said before being cut off. 

“Yep” McCarthy finished. 

After another glance to the backseat the man in the suite nodded with his head and immediately afterwards the gate blocking the entrance lifted. McCarthy eased on the gas and we went in towards the establishments entrance. There was another large group of men. About four or five, all tall and large and heavily armed.

“Maggianos Little Italy eh? I suppose if I’m going to be taken against my will I might as well get some decent Italian food out of it.” 

A low chuckle came from McCarthy. “No idea what they are going to do to you boy but I’ll be sure to get you a hot meal on my tab.” McCarthy said as a sly grin came across his face. “I suppose it’s the least I can do”.

A bit of a pause.

“He just wants to talk to you boy, that’s all. I’m sorry it has to be this way.” He continued. 

“Just wants to talk? I bet. Usually people willing to spend 10 grand on someone doesn’t want to talk. I believe I’ve seen the ending to this movie in Pulp Fiction. Something something medieval something or other”.

The group of men had opened the door. Not just one, but all of them. Like a bunch of kids surrounding a trapped ground hog. I took in a nice deep breathe. My heart no longer racing. Over the past 5 minutes or so I had come to realize that whatever happens will happen. Even though it’s mostly out of my control, if I kept my wits about me I’d get out of this. The same cliches crossing my mind from just a few moments earlier. “I refuse to sink”. “This too shall pass”. “Just Breathe”. Stupid cliches really.  

Besides. What in the hell had I done to whomever was waiting for me behind those doors? I’m just your average Joe. A nobody. I keep quiet, I keep my head down and try not to get into too much trouble. There has to have been a misunderstanding and I was anxious to get to the bottom of it. This wasn’t a bad dream, just a misunderstanding. Yeah, that was it. A misunderstanding. 

At least that’s what I kept telling myself when the group of men just stood there staring at me as they opened my door. 

“Are we going to do this the easy way or the hard way?” The bigger of the men said to me. Beckoning me to come with him. I wanted no part of that so I chose the easy way. He grabbed me and literally lifted me out of the car. My feet off the ground until I got to the sidewalk and then he gently let me down. A few men opened each of the doors and I was taken inside. 

The inside of the restaurant is exactly what you’d expect if you had gone after hours on Christmas. Chairs were upside down on their tables, the room was incredibly dark with only a few dimmed lights on. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the air and my belly rumbled reminding me that I still hadn’t eaten for the day. It was only noon but I typically would have had my coffee by now. 

The men led me inside to a back corner booth. One that looked like a sectional that happened to have a table next to it. Around the booth were a handful of men, also heavily armed with communication devices in their ears. When I had approached they parted making room around a lone chair. 

Past the chair seated in the center of the booth was a short stout man. Perhaps middle aged but I couldn’t really tell given the low light made it hard to make out any real clear features. One thing was certain regardless of the light. He commanded respect. 

As I neared the chair was pulled out for me and I sat down. Well, I was more or less used down but in order to keep control in my own mind I sat down. I looked up and locked eyes with the man for a brief moment. Surrounding the man in the middle were two incredibly beautiful women. One was a red head and another a blonde. I’d seen two red heads today which I don’t think I’ve seen in all my days of life. It must’ve been a sign. My mind drifted for a moment and then returned to the women. They were situated in such a way that made them look not like mistresses or love interests but fashion accessories. Both wearing tight red dresses showing their beautiful figures. For the span of a heartbeat I wanted so badly to live the life that this man lived. To have beautiful woman surrounding me. To have men say ‘sir’ or ‘no sir’ to me. Have the doors open for me. To have my own restaurant. To have that freshly baked bread whenever I wanted. A man can dream can’t he?

I sat there for a minute just looking around. Looking at my shoes, looking at the ceiling. 

Nothing happened. 

A few more minutes passed and still nothing. 

“So what exactly” I said before being cut off. 

The man in the middle put up his hand in a ‘stop’ fashion and I stopped. The doors behind me abruptly slammed opened and I went to look behind me but was gently elbowed to continue looking forward. 

“You’re nine grand short!” yelled a familiar voice. Again, I turned to my right to see the commotion and again I was gently elbowed to continue looking forward. “Franky, come on man. You’re nine grand short. You owe me!” continued McCarthy. By the sound of it he was expecting quite a bit more of a payout than had originally been agreed upon. 

The two men standing on either side of me went to help out their comrades and subdue the clearly angered McCarthy. Another chair was pulled out directly next to me and down sat McCarthy. He looked over at me clearly angered and then down at his shoes. 

“Heh. Join the club” I said. 

“Franky, let me have my money and I’ll get out of here. Please.”  a now somber McCarthy said. 

“My apologies McCarthy” the man said. “There was a slight miscommunication and as you can imagine, my men are not as adept at math as they appear.” 

The man was very well spoken. He oozed power and respect simply by his presence. He nodded to one of his henchman as if to give the ok and after a brief search in his coat pocket a stack of cash was thrown on the table.  It was easily 3 inches thick of unused, straight from the mint, one hundred dollar bills. Most people rarely see this much cash in their life but it was thrown on the table as if it were being used to pay for a venti cappuccino at your local Starbucks. The thud it made as it hit the table was very clearly a symbol of power that this man, presumably Franky, had amassed.  

“Thank you Franky” McCarthy quivered as he slightly rose from his chair, arm extended covering the stack of cash. 

As soon as McCarthy’s hand touched Ben Franklins faces, two hands rested on his shoulders and shoved him down. As quick as a snake striking, Franky’s hand covered McCarthy’s over the pile of cash. He rose to his feet as the women shuffled a foot or so away from him. The golden rings on his fingers glimmering in the  sparse light. 

“Before you leave” Franky said now staring down at McCarthy, two henchmen keeping McCarthy firmly in place. “I owe you nothing McCarthy. Let this be a reminder.” Two additional henchmen grabbed McCarthy’s arms and Franky reached in his sports coat pocket. 

I turned my head and closed my eyes. “Don’t kill him! Jesus don’t kill him!” I screamed. Sure, he’d sold me off the highest bidder but this was simply too much. Nobody needed to die. Not McCarthy, not me. Live and let live right? Then I remembered he sold me off to the highest bidder. 

“Never mind. He deserves whatever he has coming to him” I said still squeamish and looking away. As if on cue an elbow, this time not gently, knocked me in my head. Looking up yet another henchman. “You’re like cockroaches, all of you!” I yelled.

“I already like you” A low laugh came from across the table as I saw Franky wink at me. He removed a heavy card stock tri-folded menu from his pocket. McCarthy was still held firmly down now by four henchmen. Two holding him down in his chair, one holding each of his arms. The ladies looked at Franky and he nodded to each of them. They rose and each grabbed one of McCarthy’s fingers. The lady on Frankys left grabbed McCarthy’s index finger and the lady on Frankys right grabbed his middle finger and began to slowly stretch them apart. 

Still chuckling Franky unfolded his menu and in one quick north and south motion swiped the thick paper menu between McCarthy’s webbing of his fingers. While thankful they didn’t kill him, I’m pretty sure that was probably the worst paper cut I’d ever witnessed and it made me want to throw up. I leaned to my right dry heaving and the room erupted in laughter. McCarthy stood clutching his hand. He didn’t dare respond for fear of additional retribution so he turned and walked towards the door. 

It took a few minutes for everybody to stop laughing but eventually it died down. People were laughing about McCarthy’s response, the look in his eyes when Franky reached into his pocket. Essentially laughing at the play by play. By this time a waitress had come to our table and left a few glasses of water, some breadsticks and a nice tall glass of icy Diet Coke. 

I looked at Franky, then to the Diet Coke and then back to Franky. A quick nod to me I picked up the glass and began to drink. I didn’t realize it but I was getting my headache. The one I get when I get grumpy and don’t have my caffeine for the day. The bread. The soda. Delicious. I’d eaten as much as I possibly could as if I’d never eaten before. Franky nodded to one of the henchmen and he quickly left the room. A few moments later  a young man with glasses and a doctors coat came to sit where McCarthy had been previously. He was young. Looked as if he’d still been attending college. His nerdy disposition indicated he was a doctor. The stethoscope hanging around his neck seemed to acknowledge this reasoning. Interesting how someone who looks nerdy, wears a white lab coat and a stethoscope around their neck automatically makes you a doctor these days. 

“My name is Frank Lambardi. My associates call me Franky. You’re probably wondering why you’re here Alex.” said Franky. 

“Yeah. I don’t understand. I think this is just a misunderstanding”. I replied. 

“Perhaps a misunderstanding. Sure. Perhaps not.” Franky said. “I’m not one to take chances, or leave things to chance. Hence why you’re here. My associates believe there is something in your blood that will make you a very valuable asset. An ally. Or perhaps if handled incorrectly a very formidable foe. Which I’m not sure yet. They seem so sure of it that they are willing to go behind my back to try and reach you before I could.

It’s not my intent to harm you or yours, but I do require your assistance”. Franky continue. 

“I need a sample of your blood. Would you be willing?” 

Two hands rested firmly on my shoulder and my hoodies sleeve was rolled up by one of the ladies previously holding McCarthy’s finger. 

“Sure. Why not. Would love to help” I said. Scowling as I began to look down at my arm. The doctor positioning his chair even closer to mine. 

Franky waved his hand in a dismissive wave and all of his henchmen left. The lady on my arm stood up and began to walk away while the lady on his arm stayed. The young doctor had set his blood sampling vials down on the table along with an alcohol swab, tourniquet and a few needles. Franky cleared his throat making the doctor look at him and the doctor stopped dead in his tracks resting the needle he had next to the other vials. Loud screeching of the young man’s chair echo’d in the now silent room as he began to move his chair away from mine.

“I need your cooperation Alex. Willingly. If what my associates say is true, then I do not wish to be on your bad side, and also, if we can have a working relationship, we both can become rich beyond our wildest dreams. I will do what I must to protect my own interests. Do you understand?” Franky said in an emotionless tone. I couldn’t figure out why, but I felt like he was telling me the truth. If this was just a misunderstanding which it surely was then they’d draw blood, and I’d be able to put this day behind me. 

“It need not be like this. I can help you. You can help me. All I wish for is a sample of your blood to see if what my associates say is true. If the results are positive we will have a quick conversation and I let you go. If the results are negative we will have a quick conversation and I let you go. 

So what do you say? We harmlessly draw a small bit of blood, have a quick conversation and you go?” A grin coming across Franky’s face. 

The red headed woman stared at me licking her lips. Franky sitting across from me. The doctor only a few feet away from me. My temper started to flare but this was the absolute worst time for it. My original thought of just letting him take my blood quickly diminished. Then it quickly came back to me, the thoughts of getting home. Alive. In one piece. It had been a long day. 

“So, you take my blood. We talk. And regardless of the results you let me walk? What assurances do I have that you’ll let me walk in peace? Wouldn’t you be afraid if I called law enforcement if you let me go. What if I have what you want? Why would you just let me out of here scott free?” I said with a sharp tone. 

Franky frowned and bobbed his head as if pondering. “All valid points.” he said. “Except for a few small details you’re either missing or forgetting, or perhaps don’t know about. When you came in, did you see the cop cars protecting my vehicles?” 

I nodded.

He continued. “I work with many of the cops in the local area. If there are those that don’t work for me and call me out they will become the black sheep of the department. No raises. No promotions. So it’s not really in their best interest to raise a fuss about me. Like you I keep my head low and do what needs to be done.”

A sudden realization that he knew my name without me telling him. How did he know I liked to keep my head low? How did the waitress know I loved Diet Coke? My heart stopped and my eyes wide. 

Franky saw this and a sly smile came across his face.

“Don’t worry and yes, I know all about you. Not what you’re thinking though. We follow you online. You really should be more private online Alex.” He continued to sip on his glass of water. 

I shrugged. 

“So you threw the brick through my windshield this morning? To tip off McCarthy to my whereabouts?” I said with a tinge of frustration in my voice. 

“I don’t recall ordering a brick through your windshield.” Franky said seemingly surprised. The reaction to my question seemed to throw him off and based on his response I could tell he didn’t. 

“But getting back to your reluctance. If this test comes back negative then I have simply have no need for you. As you would say, ‘Live and let Live’”.

A cold shiver went down my spine. 

“If your blood does pass this test, then again, if we work together it’ll make us both rich! I can’t simply leave you in a room because in time you will grow too powerful. You have all the leverage here Alex.

My associates seem to believe you’re not just an average Joe. So much so that they are willing to test my resolve and my power. Plotting against me on my own turf.” Franky seemed angry just thinking about it. Not towards me I thought, but just thinking about an associate or a friend betraying his trust seemed to really get to him. 

“So please. Can we begin?”

“What is so special about my blood?” I asked. “Why is it everybody wants it? What do you mean I’ll get too powerful?”. 

Franky looked at me directly in my eyes and responded. 

“If the rumors are true, you were given something as a child unbeknownst to you to defeat it. If the rumors were true, you were on the brink of death and whatever you were given not only saved you, it’s continuing to protect you. Much more than that I don’t know Alex. I’d like to have the good doctor see if he can find anything abnormal about your blood. Once we do that, we can identify if there is anything in fact different about you.” 

“This doesn’t smell right.” I said. “This sounds like a setup and you’re making it sound like we’re buddies, and yet you had me kidnapped from my own home by a police officer just to get to me.”

“This is true Alex, but I needed to get to you before my associates did. They are not as even tempered as I am. Perhaps it was fortunate for both of us that I got to you first.” 

Franky sighed. He looked down, and then at his beautiful mistress on his arm. 

“You’re the nicest villain I think I’ve ever come across. Though to be fair I’ve not met too many villains in real life. Instead of killing a guy you give him the most wicked paper cut imaginable, you apologized to him even. And now with me. I just don’t understand.” Even after speaking, my mind was still racing and I just couldn’t figure out the end game. That’s all this was, a game. It could still be a misunderstanding but now curiosity whirled in my mind like a child in a candy store. Wondering all the possibilities. 

The power. The money. The women. 

What did I have to lose? Besides, as much as Franky said he didn’t want me as an enemy, I surely didn’t want him as an enemy. Especially not in this very moment even if what he said was true about me becoming too powerful. It seemed comical to me. My whole life mundane, the next whisked away to an Italian mobsters restaurant wanting to become pals. 

I extended my elbow to the Doc. 

“Lets just get this over with.” I said. 

The doctor came close, washed my arm with alcohol and put on a tourniquet. The needle went in painlessly much like they always do. It’s amazing how badly you think it’ll hurt only to realize you didn’t even feel it. Looking at it just makes things worst. Blood began to spill into the vials. One. Then two. Then three full vials of my blood. 

The doctor removed a rack from his coat and placed each vial in it’s holder. He then took out a few patches of paper and dipped each in their own vial. We waited. 

Franky was playing with the red haired beauty on his arm. She was feeding him grapes and had I not been so intently focused on the vials of my blood and the pieces of papers hanging from them I would’ve tried to dry heave again. 

Love. I know it when I see it and that was true love. Now that the light was on, I could see Franky and all of his features. He had a long strong jawline. Sure, he was short but you could tell it didn’t impact his confidence. He wasn’t strong or well built but you could tell he was lean. If the two were walking down the street together, there’d be no reaction or scoffs about leagues. They were in each other’s league and there was a passion there that radiated as strong as strong as the sun shown. 

I smiled, probably staring too long, and Franky looked to me. 

“What?” he said. 

“Nothing. I mean. Reminds me of my grandparents. You don’t see that too often. 

Besides. I’ve only known you for 5 minutes and you have everything I want. Rich. Successful although I don’t even want to know how, you have clearly attracted a beautiful women and the respect your men shows you is something you only see in the movies.” I responded. 

“And I’m sympathizing with a guy who might have done bad things to get there” I mumbled under my breathe. 

“I only do what needs to be done. I see opportunities and I seize them.” Franky said with a conviction in his words that I believed. 

“Well Doc” Franky asked the young man.

He nodded as if to say “Yes”. He grabbed my vials of blood, the needles, the tourniquet. Everything. Then sprinted down the hallway and out of sight.

A smile came across Franky’s face as he raised his glass of water as if to toast. The red headed woman raised her glass, locking eyes with me as if beckoning me to do the same. I grabbed my Diet Coke unsure of what the hell was going on but thankful it was coming to a close and clanked my glass with theirs. I took a nice long drink as if I were experiencing the sweet fizzing of soda against my lips for the very first time.

“You just made that doctor incredibly happy” Franky half laughing said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seem him this happy.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a large sum of cash. Easily three times the size of Ben Franklins that were previously shown to McCarthy and threw it to my side of the table in front of me. He also flicked a business card my way and I caught it midair.  

“That is just the start of it Alex. By the time you get home I’ll have a security system installed in your house with 24 hour surveillance. I’ll have my guys at the local PD circle your neighborhood in greater frequency to look out for trouble. I’ll be sure to keep my associates close to me, or at least have one eye on them at all times.

We’ll need time to understand just exactly what we are dealing with here” as Franky nodded to my arm where a little bit of blood had dribbled out “but we have everything we need until then. Eat. Drink. Be Merry.” as he looked at the money he sent my way. “I’ll be in touch. If there are any troubles, that’s my direct number. Call me.”. 

I looked down at the money. It was a large sum of money and it really could give me quite a bit of piece of mind. I was already imagining what I’d do with it. I could still smell the bread in the air so I imagined buying a room full of bread and rolling around in it. Perhaps I’d turn in the money to my bank for quarters like Scrooge McDuck and his gold coins. I could dive into it as my morning ritual right before showering. Debt. I could pay off some debt of mine. I mean, I make good money but I was staring at easily 20 thousand dollars. 

My eyes gleamed. Today had been such a roller coaster. One minute there was a brick through my windshield. Next I was being kidnapped and then finally I’m staring at a large stack of cash that was mine. That was just the beginning. I reached down towards the money and as soon as I touched it a wave of emotion came over me. 

I just couldn’t do it. How many people did he hurt to get this amount of money? Did he have to kill people? Did he steal from people? I don’t think I could live with myself.

Wrapping my hands around the cash felt great. I had to feel it between my hands. At least once. I picked it up and put it back down. I tapped it a few times as if contemplating. 

“Do me a favor Franky?” I asked. 

“Sure. Whatever you want”. He responded. 

“Give it to charity? The Ronald McDonald house?”. 

“You got it Alex.” he said as he winked and again raised his glass of water to me. 

I turned around and started to leave for the door. After a few steps abruptly turned around and headed back towards the stack of cash.

I slipped a hundred dollar bill from one of the stacks and said “I need cab to get home.” 

“Ahh.” Franky said. 

Again, I walked towards the door and then abruptly turned around and headed again to the stack of cash. I quickly snuck a few extra bills out of the stack. Raising the money to Franky he looked back at me with one eyebrow raised. 

“My windshield. You say you didn’t throw a brick through it, but hey, someone has to pay for it. Might as well be the richest man in the room.”. I pointed towards him and he pointed back. “Ok, I’m leaving. For real this time.”

I walked quickly for the exit. The dim light in the room making it hard to navigate but like a mouse experiencing freedom in a lab for the first time, I was destined to find the door and to get out of dodge. 

I stood on the sidewalk. Guards looking at me as if nothing had happened. The caravan still parked outside. The sun beaming on my face. Standing there and taking it all in. What a day. Thankful to be alive I wanted to stop and breathe. To smell the roses. To feel the sun on my face and it felt good. I shoved the money in my short pockets patted myself down in hopes of locating my phone. My front hoodie pouch felt heavy and I patted it too. I felt the rectangular object in my hoodie pocket and rummaged around in the hopes to getting an Uber ride home. 

My phone appeared. Along with the money that was wrapped around the brick from earlier this morning. I smiled. I suppose I double dipped on my windshield. “Oh well” I thought to myself. “That just means I’ll buy something nice for myself later on. Perhaps that loaf of bread I’ve been thinking about for the past hour. 

“Sir. You dropped something. Fell out of your pocket.” one of the guards said, pointing to the ground towards a white piece of paper. 

“Oh. Thanks” I replied before looking down. 

There was a piece of paper on the floor and I picked it up. It looked familiar. It should’ve been, as it was the piece of paper that was wrapped in money accompanying a brick that somehow found it’s way through my windshield. I opened it up and there was a message inside. 

“Alex. Keep your blood to yourself. It can be used against you. We’ll explain later. 8pm tonight at 1632 Lasalle Street. Be there or be square.”

Lovely. Just lovely. 

“Keep your blood to yourself”

Not a phrase I thought I’d ever hear. Not a phrase I ever felt would send cold chills down my spine.
