## Chapter 8

“Wake up Alex … We’re here” Kyle said, giving me a less than gentle shake. 

I looked towards, him, and then looked towards his hands on my shoulders and then back to him. 

“Sorry” he said. “You’re a tough cookie to wake. We said your name multiple times, we tried even yelling but you wouldn’t wake. We tried to nudge you, and well, here we are”. 

I laughed. “No worries” I said while wiping the sleep out of my eyes. “I’ve never been a light sleeper so it was probably warranted.

Where are we?”

A smile grew across Lauren and Kyle’s face and after a brief pause and a quick glance at one another Lauren said, “Your new home.”

I looked around to get my bearings. The clock on the dashboard read ten o’clock. The night was dark and the stars were out. They were so beautiful. I’m not entirely sure why that particular thought crossed my mind. “The stars were always out” I thought to myself, “sometimes we just can’t see them”.

The van rolled from side to side as it made a right turn into a rather large office complex. There were garage doors similar to those you’d find at shipping facilities. Clearly this place received a lot of deliveries. Or at least the companies inhabiting the office space. The complex was well lit with street lamps every 20 yards or so illuminating the hustle and bustle that was taking place. While this looked like an ordinary office complex, it most certainly wasn’t. The parking lot was full of cars, there were people playing soccer off to the side and the top of the rooftops looked like it were teeming with life too. 

The patios all had BBQs that were emitting smoke with small groups of drink wielding people huddled around. In the front lawn was an olympic sized swimming pool. There was a waterfall at least 2 stories tall with men and women jumping in. Mimicking a cliff dive near an ocean, yet all situated in the middle of nowhere. My eyes followed a pair of college aged men jumping into the water. A large splash and as they swam to the edge a large group of people huddled around.

What seemed like a full minute passed. As if having an epiphany I realized exactly what was said. My mind wanders and I’m admittedly a little slow in the head sometimes. “No … I have a home. I have a job. I have a life and it’s not here” I replied. Still staring intently on all the hustle and bustle of this little campus. 

My gaze went across the street to what appeared to be more office space. This time no Barbecue’s, pools or dance floors. It looked like it was strictly business. “So many go-getters here, don’t they ever go home? It’s called work-life balance, or do they not know about that word?” I said, pointing to all the people visible in their offices.

“This is their home, and theirs too” Lauren responded. Pointing in a wide sweeping motion. “They live here, they work here, all for R.A.S.

Regarding your home, your life. That was then and this is now. We will talk, I promise, but for now lets get you inside and settled. There’s too much to discuss and to much to show you. If after your night here you still wish to be home, we will take you.” She said, looking at Kyle. “We’ll personally drop you off. Okay?”

My chin hit my chest as I looked down. Then my eyes moved towards my clothing that was torn, dirty and, and … wrinkled. I _hate_ wrinkled clothes. I let out a long drawn out sigh. 

“Sure, You have until morning. Think I could get a shower and my clothes washed first?”

“Deal”. 

They both smiled and turned towards the front of the van as they both sunk into their seats. I wasn’t sure if that was due to exhaustion or elation at the fact I didn’t put up much of a fight regarding the whole situation.

There had just been too much crazy in my life for my liking the past few days. McCarthy the hillbilly cop. Franky the mobster. What in the heck was that contraption? Wayne the psychotic murdering nut job. I had too many questions that needed answering. I told myself once I found out the answers to those questions I’d bail. Hopefully all while living a normal life, at my house, sleeping in my bed. My warm and cozy bed. I shivered just thinking about it. Then I got to thinking about work. 

Man. 

I forgot about work. Pretty sure my boss is going to kill me if he hasn’t already fired me. 

Man. 

I’ve said it before and I’ll continue to say it. My life just keeps getting better and better.

The van drove to behind the building and the driver lifted his arm to the visor and pressed a button on, what appeared to be a garage door opener. As the door lifted, 2 armed men walked to the driver’s door and they began to talk in low hushed voices. The man coming on the passenger side had his light shining throughout the vehicle. It paused on me and I lifted my arm to block the insanely bright light. After a brief pause the light continued on to the other passengers. There were 3 men sitting in front of Kyle and Lauren. All appeared to be middle aged grizzled looking guys. They were conversing back and fourth, occasionally laughing and pointing at various things. 

The driver removed some paperwork from his duffle bag and handed it over to the guard. A few quick scans, a shuffle of paper here and there and then finally a quick glance to the other guard. One guard motioned with his light, the other with his rifle a “hurry up and move along” motion. The gate lifted, the tire spikes lowered and we were on our way.

The parking garage was full of cars. We kept circling the lot looking for a spot as if we were holiday shoppers at the local mall at Christmas time. After 10 minutes of circling, going farther and farther down I noticed an open spot. 

“Hey man! You missed it, an open spot on the left!” I yelled. Hoping to get the driver’s attention. 

“Stupid backseat drivers” I heard the man say, in a thick Spanish accent. Both Kyle and Lauren turned to look at me. 

“We’re not parking here, we’re headed to ‘the abyss’. It’s about  5 miles from here, a half mile underground. Hence ‘the abyss’”. Kyle said. “It’s another half hour or so before we get there. Take a nap. At the very least close your eyes. Helps with the dizziness on the descent” Lauren continued. 

5 minutes. Then 10 minutes. Then 15 minutes passed. Sure, it’d only been 5 minute intervals but it felt like an hour between each. I suppose time stands still when you’re wanting it to pass. At this point there were no other cars. Probably better that way as we were traveling down a claustrophobically tight one way tunnel. It was wide enough for a semi to pass through and enough space on either side to comfortably drive down, but too tight to open the door to get out in case of an emergency. 

Lovely. At least it was well lit.

My mind wandered. What _would_ happen in an emergency. At least the tunnel was well lit but where would we go? What if the van got a flat tire. Even worse, what if it caught fire? What if the tunnel flooded? 

What can I say, I’m a pessimist. Glass is always half empty. Always has been, always will be. Lets just say it’s something I’m working on. 

A moment later a loud pop echoed throughout the tunnel. The van jostled to the left almost hitting the van against the tunnel wall.  

The van slowed, making a thumping noise every few seconds. Once stopped, the driver rolled his window down, peeked his head out of his window and sighed. He shook his head, and turned to look towards the rear of the van towards all of it’s occupants. 

“Looks like we’re walking the rest of the way”.

“God dammit!” I said between clinched, but a teeth baring smile. Unfastening my seatbelt I continued “I freaking knew it”.

We had to open the rear van doors, crawl onto of the van, onto it’s roof and then down it’s hood. Then began our walk further towards, or should I say into, the abyss. Luckily the tunnel had incredibly tall ceilings. Maybe 50 feet tall. It helped ease the claustrophobic feeling I was getting in the tunnel a bit, but only a bit. 

I looked around noticing blinking lights on the sides of the walls.

“It’s for the semi’s that deliver to the Abyss. There are no drivers, it’s all automated. It’s too tight of a squeeze for a regular Joe”. 

“Jules” continued the man, in a thick French accent, hand extended offering it for a shake. “And those are my brothers Gabriel and Arthur”. Pointing to the other two men as we shook hands. 

“Milk mans son too I take it?” I said nodding to his two brothers. “My entire family has jet black hair, except for me, I’m the only blonde in the family” I laughed, nodding to my blonde hair.

Jules was incredibly tall, perhaps 6 foot 3 and had jet black hair that went down to his lower back. His eyes were hazel. Well, eye rather. His left eye was covered in an eye patch, and a large thick scar ran from the top of his forehead down towards his lower cheek. Accented by the five o’clock shadow of his stubble that refused to grow near it. He looked like a man who had seen some things, but his demeanor and first impression exuded that of a teddy bear. A teddy bear I didn’t intend to fight with. As a man, I know my place in the world, and I’m pretty sure I’d last about a half second in the ring with him if I didn’t pass out from fear beforehand. He was thin, but solidly built. And his handshake might as well have been that of a vice grip. Like his two brothers, he was wearing black leather pants, a white shirt and a black leather coat that went down to their knees. 

He looked towards his brothers, whose blonde hair you could see from a mile away, then back to me. “No. Postman” he grinned. 

Jules didn’t look anything like his brothers. The two other men were short and looked identical to one another. The blondest hair I’d ever seen. They were short and stocky, well built but dwarfs compared to their brother. Jules looked older and more worn too. It’s a little hard to describe, but his brothers looked more like fratboys whom Jules was babysitting. 

Gabriel an Arthur approached us. We exchanged handshakes and introductions and then began to walk. It was seemingly never ending tunnel.  


Gabriel and Arthur were discussing how hungry they were and how they were craving their mother’s Soupe à l'oignon. Apparently it was a beef and onion styled stew they had grown up with. All of this talk was making me hungry.  

“This place better have a Panda Express” I said out loud, to no one in particular. “Especially if I have to hoof it there”. 

“Even better … they have a food court. McDonalds. My favorite American meal.” Gabriel said in response.

“And!” chimed in Arthur, “they have a Cheesecake Factory! Much better than that other crap”, as he turned and looked at me to wink. 

“What … Seriously?” I replied in disbelief.

“Seriously” he said, laughing, “that’s where I think we should eat tonight considering you don’t believe me”. 

“I believe you, I just can’t believe we’re a half mile down, god knows how many miles in a one way tunnel, a place with a bloody McDonalds AND … AND a Cheesecake Factory yet no Panda Express? Pfff … ridiculous. Unbelievable really”. I said, explaining my disbelief. 

Come to think of it, it _was_ crazy the situation I found myself in. I mean sure, the group had probably done this journey a thousand times but I hadn’t. We were a half mile underground, traveling miles on a one way road to god only knows where, which apparently has a bloody Cheesecake Factory.

Where the heck were we, and why was I not as frightened as I should’ve been? 

“So what is this Abyss?” I asked, turning to look back at Kyle and Lauren. 

“It’s a research facility, among many things”. Kyle answered. “You’ll see”. 

“So. Are we there yet?” I asked, looking to Lauren. 

“Not yet kiddo, See those large red numbers we’ve been passing? 
Those represent the quarter miles remaining. The last one we passed was 12, so 3 more miles.” She said turning to point towards the large red “12” written on the side of the wall. 

We walked another 10 steps and I asked “Are we there yet?” 

Kyle rolled his eyes at me. 

“You have questions, as do we Alex.” He said while they both nodded towards each other. 

“Quid pro quo then?” I replied.

“Quid pro quo?” Kyle said, looking at me a bit confused. 

“You know, The silence of the lambs. You ask a question, I ask a question in return. We keep going until one of us has nothing to say, etc etc ..” 

“Ahhh, ok sure. You’re up first then. Fair is fair”. 

“Where are we?” I asked. 

“The abyss. It’s a research facility among other things. It’s better to show you then to tell you. The main campus, what you saw coming in houses tens of thousands of R.A.S employees. It’s their office space too with dorms on the side. Think of it like college, but for grown ups. This tunnel leads to the Abyss, and it’s designed with security in mind. We don’t want anything coming in or leaving without out authorization. Especially leaving” he said, shaking off a cold chill. 

He continued. “Did you know we were going to get a flat tire?”

I hesitated for a moment thinking about it. 

“I mean, sort of but not really. I thought something bad would happen and it did. I thought it’d be a fire, or a flat, or a flood, or some other emergency that started with the letter F so I guess you could say that I did. I’m just a pessimist though, not clairvoyant.”

He looked to Lauren and then back to me.

“So you thought it would happen and it happened?” He said.

“I mean, I’m not Xavier or a Jedi or anything. I can’t just move objects with my mind. I do on the very rare occasion get lucky. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been on a Ferris wheel thinking it’d fall apart, or I’d be catapulted from it’s seat. Guess how many times I’ve thought that? Probably a million. Guess how many times it’s come true? Never. That was one in a billion. Just a little luck is all and it’s not like I wanted it to happen. It was just a thought and it was random chance that my random thought coincided with what actually happened. I mean, I like walking with you fine folks” I continued, twirling about on my heels with my arms spread out pointing in everybody’s general direction. 

“But I’d rather be asleep right now.”

“Makes sense”, lauren said, nodding. “I suppose it happens to all humans from time to time.”

“Yeah”. I shrugged. “I’m only human. Lucky, or unlucky at that”.

“Not to be rude, or break up a happy relationship but what’s the deal with Franky” I said, meeting Lauren at her eyes. 

I was a little surprised when I heard Kyle respond. 

“Nothing” he said. “She went undercover as his mistress. She had to get close to him to get answers and additional intel. Don’t worry, no secrets between us. Franky and Wayne were associates. Franky has a lot of dirt on Wayne, and Wayne has a lot of research that could prove pivotal to our cause. We need his research. _Need_”. He emphasized the word need a bit too long I thought, but I could tell he was being sincere. A part of me was grateful I hadn’t “spilled the beans” on anything. I don’t have the necessary tact required to socialize among friends, let alone strangers, so I was relieved to say the least.

I rolled my eyes and in my best Austin Powers voice replied. 

“Riiiiiight”

Lauren looked down. “I wasn’t happy being one of many ladies that filthy son of a bitch had around his arm, but I was doing it for humanity”.

The tone in her voice made me sober up rather quickly. Not that I was drunk or anything. It just conveyed raw, powerful emotion.

Quickly interjecting Kyle asked “So what else happens in your day to day life that you would characterize as odd. Or only happening to you?”. 

I could tell he wanted to change the subject and I was all to happy to oblige. A part of me didn’t want to say something I shouldn’t have at the most in opportune time and cause a fight between the two. 

“Yeah. You know I have this superpower that nobody knows about. It’s pretty amazing. You see when I walk past street lights they”. I was stopped mid sentence. 

There was a loud explosion, exponentially louder than the first when the tire disintegrated. This sounded like a bomb going off. I turned to look down the tunnel only to find the van as a red dot in the distance. It looked like it caught fire, and given the gasoline still in the tank my guess is it had. 

“Big. Big Badda Boom.” I said, laughing. My hands shaking and my heart thumping so loudly and violently I thought it was going to escape through my ribcage. 

“Big. Bad Boom?” Lauren said, with a confused look on her face.

“Yeah, The Fith Element. You two need to watch more movies together. Make it a point to have date night or something” I said, half laughing, still half gasping for air. 

This was all too comical for me. Not because it was funny, more so because I was just happy to be alive. The exploding in my ears and the sudden rush of fear I had at that very moment made me a bit hysterical. I tried to collect my emotions and my thoughts.

 How would the van have caught fire? It was just a flat tire?  

“You did say you thought the van would catch fire”. Kyle said, with an intrigued look on his face.

I put my hands in the air claiming innocense. 

“I was here walking with you two. Not my fault!” I replied, finally catching my breathe. My hands still trembling and my heart now firmly implanted in my throat. “I’ve been here with you two all along!”.

Lauren and Kyle both looked at me with blank stares on their faces. 

“It was a joke. Just a joke. Of course I didn’t do that to the van.”

Jules, Arthur and Gabriel all turned around in unison to take stock of the situation. Once they realized the van was the culprit, the three men turned around and continued walking.

The driver also turned around. Lauren pointed at him and then the van and he shrugged. He was too far away to talk to, or to yell at but with his hands raised you could tell it was a shrug. He then grabbed his duffle bag off the ground, turned around and continued walking. 

“Strange” Kyle said, “Very strange. Alex, you said it would get a flat AND catch fire. A fl …”. 

“Seriously” I said, cutting him off from continuing. “It was a joke. Sure, I thought about it, but I never thought it’d happen that way. Remember, one and a million? It was just a passing thought. Nothing more, nothing less. Why are you latching on that?”

“Okay.” he said, “So what is this super power of yours then? Something about street lights?”

“Oh right”. I said, half laughing, “That’s just a joke to clarify too, but yeah, I can make street lights tu …”. 

Again, I was interrupted mid sentence.

The lights flickered in the tunnel and then to darkness. Complete and utter darkness. 

“I can make street lights turn off just by walking past them!” I screamed, hearing each of my laughs reverberate down the tunnel. 

“It’s a gift, what can I say? I just walk past them and *POOF* they just turn out”. My hands making an explosion gesture. Which I’m not sure why I did that, given I couldn’t even see my hands, let alone could those in the tunnel with me. 

“Impressive” I heard Kyle say a few yards away from me “Can you turn them back on?”

“I’m not a miracle worker man. Besides, that’s a bit outside of my capabilities”

The lights flickered and then came back on. 

“Speak of the devil. I guess I am a miracle worker after all” I said, looking towards Kyle. 

He was frantically looking around, both behind and ahead of him.  I looked around too. Sudden realization dawned on me. The van that was behind us was no longer there and the tunnel was empty besides myself and Kyle. 

The van. Lauren. Jules. Arthur. Gabriel. Gone. All gone. 

What seemed like only a few seconds passed since the last time my heart was in my throat and there I found it again, firmly lodged in my throat. 

I looked towards Kyle. He was staring at the ceiling. 

Shaking, voice quivering. “Kyle … what is it man?” As I looked up I saw Lauren on all fours on the ceiling. She was crawling across the ceiling. 

“Move you two! Move! I’ll get the others” She screamed. With lightning fast quickness, she crawled on all fours, upside down on the ceiling of the tunnel and within moments she was 30 yards ahead of us. 

I stood there in utter disbelief. She was upside down, crawling on the ceiling with what appeared to be little to no effort. To add to that, within a moment she was almost out of sight. Just like that. Not quite sure if it was her warning, or what I was witnessing I couldn’t move my limbs. I wanted to run, if anywhere, I wanted to run the opposite way I’d seen Lauren go. Why would I follow _that_ to my doom? What the hell was she? What was _that_. 

I started to run towards the van. I wanted absolutely no part of what was about to take place. My fight or flight instance kicked in and I wanted flight. I wanted flight so badly. I wanted to backtrack my steps and get out of that god forsaken tunnel. To go home, crawl into bed and pull my covers over my head and wake up from this terrible dream like I’ve done so many times before in the past. 

Kyle grabbed my arm and when I wouldn’t follow he slapped me in the face. Open hand, full on little bitch mode. This was’t a dream, that slap to the face hurt. 

“Get it together man! This way. This way” he said, pointing towards the direction Lauren went.

There were loud screeching noises coming from down the hall. The lights continued to flicker and I couldn’t help but run forward and look back. Outlined in the flickering lights were creatures that were on all fours. Much like Lauren, except they were terrifying. A thing only conceived of in nightmares. As they came closer I could see the flesh hanging off there bones, decaying and rotting. The smell hitting my nose in nauseating wave after nauseating wave. 

Their hands and feet, whatever you’d call their extremities, were nothing but bone. Their screeching louder and louder. Two of the hideous things were coming our way, all looking at me with empty eye sockets. Streams of blood oozing from once functioning noses and mouths. Their chests covered in what looked like vests. 

They came closer and closer and I could make out the word “Guard” on the vests they were wearing. Across their shoulders wrapped were assault rifles. They were the guards we’d seen just an hour or so before. Transformed into hideous beasts. I didn’t know what was motivating them, but it was certain they were coming for us and they were none too pleased. Running as fast as I could, I couldn’t see light at the end of the tunnel unfortunately. Only Kyle, and he was keeping pace with me at my side. 

“Where was Jules! Where was anybody!” I thought to myself. “Where did they go!”

I was exhausted. I felt like I’d just ran a marathon but the quarter mile markers slowly went by. This chase started somewhere between 11 and 10, and I had just passed marker number 8. I was already exhausted before this, but this had taken me to my breaking point. 

I didn’t know what to do but try and keep running. It seemed hopeless though. 

Like a tv antenna that needed adjusting, Jules and his two brothers appeared out of thin air. Fuzzy and flickering at first, then solid objects Kyle and I ran into the brothers. 

Jules grabbed Kyle and I and flung us to the ground while Arthur and Gabriel had shotguns firing in both directions at the guards. Covering my ears I looked back to see the guards twitching on the ground, squealing and screeching from their newly inflicted wounds by the brothers. 

Jules grabbed Kyle and I by our necks and in one heavy heave lifted us both to our feet. The two brothers already out in front of us running, guns in hand.

“Lets go … Before more come” He said. 

A loud scream came from behind us and I turned around only to see one of the guards flying towards me. Mouth open, arms out stretched and nothing but rotted flesh peeling away from bone. The next second there was a loud bang and the guard dropped to the floor like a rock. Looking behind me was the van driver peering down the scope of his rifle. Putting more rounds in the now lifeless guard. 

The driver dropped his rifle to the ground and turned to run. 

Yeah. You don’t need to tell me twice. It’s pretty easy to run when you might become some creatures food. So I ran too. Until the red numbers counted down to “1”. 

There wasn’t light at the end of the tunnel to my surprise. I suppose that only happens in fairy tales and good books. Nope, no light, only more questions, a lot of heavy breathing and a very, very large vaulted door that read:

“Abyss Research Facility”
