# Lucky number 7
## Chapter 7

I’m not sure if it was the smell of death or the smell of blood that had brought me back to consciousness but whatever it was it had my attention. I cracked my eyes just a smidge only to see that I had awoken in the lap of the beautiful red haired woman whom I couldn’t quite remember. 

Through the slightest crack of my eyelids I could see her staring down at me with the most the most beautiful blue eyes ever imagined. As it turns out I didn’t fight it as she said before I had been pistol whipped. I closed my eyes in the hopes of returning to my slumber. My head and my body ached and I was ready for whatever to happen happen. With heavy eye lids I slipped back into sleep. 

A moment later a pain washed over my body as my cheek was slapped. 

“I saw that … wake up” she said. 

I sat up shaking the fogginess that had yet to wear off from being asleep for a while. Apparently being cracked in the head with the butt end of the pistol has it’s perks. I’d do it more often if it meant waking up in the lap of a beautiful woman. Then it dawned on me. 

“I had a hard time figuring out who you were, but you’re Franky’s lady”. I said. 

“Shhhh …” she replied, putting her index finger over her lips. “That’s not entirely true but that is where you know me from.”

Looking at her, then to the dead man that was next to her and then back again I asked “Where is Franky? What are we doing here?”

“There isn’t any time to explain it all.” as she looked towards the door. Hearing a few men speaking outside the hallway. “Really quick. The man who kidnapped you is Wayne. He works for the government and is a crook. The doctor that works for him is Kyle. Wayne bad. Kyle good. Got it?”

Confused and looking around I nodded.

“And who is that?” I asked, pointing to the dead man next to her. 

“That’s Charles. A friend of Franky’s. They were having dinner, just catching up when the Wayne and his military goons came in and took Franky. There was a standoff and a bunch of people got hurt. They took us, Wayne brought us here and then you showed up.” she responded. 

“And what’s your name?” I asked. 

“Lauren”

“And …” I started before she cut me off. 

“Listen, Kyle has connections and they are coming for us. Lay low. Buy us whatever time you can until they get here.”

“Until who gets here?” 

As the words came out of my mouth the door opened. The men in the hallway that were chatting came back in. It was Wayne, Kyle and a third man. He was carrying the crystal contraption that I had found at my camping spot. It wasn’t large, but it wasn’t light either I could tell and he struggled carrying the thing across the room to where Lauren and I were situated. 

Wayne threw my notebook at me as the third man slammed the contraption down to the floor breathing deeply. It didn’t look heavy, but looks can be deceiving. 

“Who are you transmitting to?” Wayne said as he made a beeline to me pointing at the crystal … thing. I still had no clue what the thing was. I was on my feet by this time, my wrists still bound by handcuffs that emitted a soft green glow. Looking towards the floor I saw the potato sac that was taken off my head what had to have been only a few minutes earlier. The blood from Charles pooling and filling the air with the smell of death. I looked down at my chest pocket to find the silver pen Fanz had given to me earlier in the day. 

Earlier in the day? Was it still the same day that I had the encounter with Franky and Fanz? I honestly didn’t know. The room was dark and windowless and I hadn’t had an opportunity to ask. Perhaps it was the same day, or perhaps I’d been unconscious for so long that days had past. Perhaps weeks? Knowing the day at this point in my predicament was the least of my worries. 

“Who am I transmitting what to?” The words rolling off my lips in pure confusion. 

Enranged, Wayne pointed at the “thing”. “THAT. WHO WERE YOU TRANSMITTING TO?” 

“I don’t know man. I don’t know”. I replied. 

I thumbed through the notebook. Shaking my head I repeated, “I don’t know man. I don’t know”. 

“You’re lying.” he said. Livid, he pulled the gun from his holster and pointed his gun at Lauren. 

“I’m going to ask one more time. Who were you transmitting to. What was your message to them?” Wayne said, clarifying. 

“Honest. I don’t know. All I know is I went camping. I woke up when I was sleep walking. I saw the notebook and that thing.” I said, as I pointed to the thing in the middle of the room. “Then you showed up. I’m here. I have no clue man. I have no clue what’s going on. That’s the god honest truth.”

“So let me get this straight”, Wayne said, sarcastically. “You have a notebook, with all your information in it, with schematic and formulas that exactly match this transmitter. We find you tinkering with it and the best response you can come up with is ‘You were sleep walking’?” The rage clearly consuming Wayne. 

“You had 15 years of building and transmitting and THIS is the best excuse you could come up with?”. Wayne said again, as if to repeat himself in utter disbelief. 

I stood in front of Lauren and went to my knees. 

“Leave her alone man, she didn’t do anything. This is between you and I. Again, I don’t know what’s going on. That’s the god honest truth.” I wasn’t sobbing at this point but I am in utter disbelief and my voice quivered. 

I started to laugh uncontrollably at this point. 

This was all crazy. Stupid really. I honestly don’t know what the hell is going on but apparently I’d been building a transmitter in my sleep. For who or for what I was still clueless but even so, it didn’t mean someone had to take a bullet for this. How in the H-E-Double hockey sticks did I end up here? I went camping to think, and now I’m here. I’m so confused. 

“This is funny to you?” Wayne said, all but screaming. “This is a joke?” as he shot Charles motionless body on the floor multiple times. “WHO!”

I looked Wayne dead in the eyes. “I don’t know what in the hell you’re talking about man. For gods sake, I don’t. All I know is I woke up in front of that _thing_ with that notebook at my feet and then you showed up.”

A realization washed over Wayne’s face. 

He laughed. “You honestly don’t know do you?”. 

Wayne looked towards the doctor Kyle, “Do you want to see the years of my research?”

Kyle looked at me, then Lauren and then back at Wayne. 

“Absolutely” Kyle replied. 

A gasp came from behind me as Lauren sat in disbelief. Shaking her said she uttered “But why Kyle? Why?”

Wayne whistled to the unknown man in the room and nodded his head in my direction. The man’s breathing had recovered now as he grabbed my shoulders and shoved me into the nearby chair. 

Walking towards me pulling his phone out of his pocket he started to explain. “Alex, you see those handcuffs? Those are the best handcuffs your government has produced in the past 50 years. If you tamper with them, they’ll engage. If my heartbeat fades or drops“ he continued, pointing to his watch while waiving his smartphone around “they engage. Basically, if you’re anything but a gentleman, they engage.”

“They engage?” I asked. Still confused. 

“They engage. More on that in a moment. But first, an artist rendition using your arm as a canvas.” The man grabbed my arms and held them firmly outstretched as Wayne walked to me. Putting his phone away and withdrawing a knife from his hip holster, the glade glimmering in whatever light remained, began to make an incision in my arm. 

It wasn’t deep, but it was painful. I struggled to move my arms but the the two men overpowered me and I was simply trapped in place. There was nothing left I could do except to let Wayne carve into my arm with his knife. 

“You see Alex, this is as they say, ‘but a flesh wound’. This hurts, but it wouldn’t kill you. Wouldn’t you agree?” 

I’m not a hardened man by any stretch of the imagine, I’m a software engineer for crying out loud. Sure, I’ve experienced pain, a lot of it, but having a sick psychopath carving a bad mural on my forearm was a new experience for me. It hurt, but it was the fact that it was happening to me and there was nothing I could do to control it was what troubled me the most. 

As the blood run from my forearm, he wiped his blade across the incision to reveal a circle with a “G” in the middle of it. 

“Genesis”. He whispered as he admired his work. 

“Years of research, luck and hope all wrapped into one word”. 

“You’re crazy!” Lauren said still sitting on the floor. “You’re crazy … why are you doing this?”

“Why am I doing this?” Wayne shouted as he walked towards Lauren. “I’m doing this for the future of humanity. I’m doing this of course for the money. Mostly for the money. Do you know how much people will pay for this formula? Me and my team will be rich beyond imagine. It’s coming … but there is one thing that’s still missing.” as he looked at me.

Wayne’s absolute resolve and focus on what he was saying was terrifying. His voice echo’d true belief in his cause, that he felt he was doing the right thing. He reached for his phone and pulled it out. He waited a brief moment, looked at Kyle and then towards me. Pressed a button and within a few seconds the green glow of my handcuffs brightened as they came to life. 

Pain as I’ve never experienced before shot through my wrist. Ten or so needles struck into my left wrist as the green glowing liquid flowed into my body. As if fire liquid were injected into me I could feel it enter my bloodstream and slowly start traveling up my arm. 

“You see Alex, the handcuffs engaged. A special blend of bacteria and acid have been injected into your bloodstream rendering the patient effectively dead in just a few minutes time. Basically, the handcuffs are designed to keep you from being a problem, or to keep you from living. Your choice. Or mine. Depending on how you look at it”.

As my heart beat in my chest, I could feel what amounted to liquid fire traveling throughout my system. I could feel it traveling up my arm and into my chest and once it hit my heart, it radiated throughout my body. My vision went blurry and my body went limp. My chin now resting on my chest it was only a matter of time before I joined the ranks of the dead. 

“The concoction flowing through your system now is enough to kill a thousand men.” Wayne said, continuing to pace around my chair. “Except your body treats it like a little cold. You should be dead by now and yet here you are. Alive and well.”. 

Wayne spoke but it sounded as if my head was in a bubble. His voice echo’d throughout my head, my vision still blurred and with each word Wayne spoke, the sound growing louder and louder bouncing between my ears.  

Without warning everything went silent. My eyes closed, my chin still on my chest and my body went limp. 

Another gasp came from he corner of the room where Lauren had sat. 

“No! No!” she screamed.

“Don’t worry love” Wayne said, “He’s ok. I promise”.

A moment later, I opened my eyes. I felt right as rain. One moment liquid fire pulsated throughout my body, the next I felt as if I had just awoken from a 12 hour nap. 

“Impossible” Muttered Kyle. As he came to my side, opening my eyelids, pulling his stethoscope from his lab coat and listening to my heart. 

Thump. Thump. On and on my heart beat. 

“But … but … how is this possible?” Kyle said in utter disbelief looking towards Wayne.

“All in good time Kyle, all in good time.” Wayne said. “But for now, just know this young man will be our guinea pig until we figure out the missing ingredient. We will find it, with or without his cooperation. He will bleed until he’s at the brink of death, he will recover and then he will bleed out again. Over and over until we find what it is we need Kyle, but make no mistake, he is the key to all of this” Wayne said as he made his way towards the door. 

Every ache in my body, the incision in my arm and just about every ailment I’ve had in the past few weeks was just … it was just gone. 

“How is this possible?” I too said in disbelief. 

Wayne stopped and turned around. The look on his face made it seem like he'd just won a prize at the fair.

“You are subject number 7 in the research project Genisis we were conducting. Our first human subject, Cassidy, 14 year old Leukemia patient passed away almost immediately. A few iteration and test subjects later led us to a breakthrough. Subject number 3 died only a few weeks after the serum was injected, with every subject’s longevity lasting only a few days more than the previous. But you … you were the last subject in our research and you happen to be the only one left alive all this time later. But why? What is different about you Alex?”

“Our facilities, along with most of our research were destroyed by a colleague of ours. Dr O. I believe know of her yes?” he asked.

“Yes.” I said, as my memory flashed back. “She was my oncologist”.

“Why of course” he replied as a maniacal smile came across his face. “We will find out soon enough”. 

The sound and echo of the bullet leaving the chamber towards Wayne’s chest was extremely loud and startling to me. The next bullet that left the chamber of Kyle’s gun was equally loud and starting as I looked behind me in the chair I was situated in. On the ground was the unknown man shaking with blood coming from his mouth as if he were drowning. 

Wayne hit the floor and started to convulse but he was still alive. At least for now. 

Kyle stood there gun drawn as Lauren ran to his side. They embraced, a quick kiss and he began to unlock her handcuffs. Foreheads resting against each others for just a brief moment, eyes locked as if reading each other’s thoughts they both looked towards me.

“I’m sorry Alex” Kyle said. 

“For what?”. And before I even had a chance to comprehend what was happening, the glowing green liquid from my right handcuff came to life. 

“For that” Kyle said as he nodded to the remaining part of my handcuff. 

“You’ve got to be kidding me. I don’t think you realize how painful this was the last time” and with that the handcuff and it’s needles injected into my wrist, the burning sensation pulsating throughout my body. Exactly as it had happened the last time, my body went limp and by the time I knew it, I was feeling right as rain again. 

Kyle and Lauren came to my side and wrapped their arms around me lifting me from the chair and began to drag me towards the door. A siren began to blare across the speaker system in the rooms and it sounded as if it were in the hallway as well. I had to assume it was going off throughout the whole facility given Wayne had died. By the looks of how sophisticated these handcuffs were, I had to imagine the whole facility was tied to his pulse and contingent on him being alive. As we approached the door, with the alarm blaring, the handle shook and the door opened. 

As if in lockstep, we all froze as the door opened and a man wearing military fatigues and assault rifle emerged. 

“Stay right there” the soldier said over the blaring sirens going off.

Without hesitation Lauren ran to the door and in one swift round house kick to the face immobilized the man, grabbed his assault rifle, and patted the man down for any other weapons he might’ve had on him. Reaching for his back pocket and a set of zip ties, bound the soldier’s hands together. 

The whole immobilization and pat down took what seems to be five seconds. 

Kyle and I both stared at Lauren in disbelief. 

“Wow”. I mumbled looking towards Kyle. “Lucky man. She’s way out of your league.”

“I know!” He said, chuckling. 

“But you know she’s Franky’s …” I said before Lauren cut me off. 

“Hurry your asses you two” Lauren screamed holding open the door and looking at me with a glare that could cause hell to freeze over. She continued, now poking her head out and into hallway. “We don’t have much time. They should be meeting us at the end of this corridor”. 

I had been through hell, and it felt like I was experiencing a wicked hangover. Noticing I wouldn’t make it on my own Kyle forcefully threw me over his shoulder and in a fireman carry ran through the door and down the corridor. 

Lauren kicked through the double door which was incredibly impressive given the high heels she was sporting. With the assault rifle strap around her shoulder and waiving it in an authoritative posture we went through the double doors to the awaiting van. 

The cool breeze hit my skin and the fresh air hit my nostrils and it was as if I’d won a million dollars. It was like instant medicine and it felt so incredibly good. 

The van’s large sliding door swung open as if it were in a bonafide heist and Fanz appeared. 

“How is he” Fanz asked, looking towards Kyle and then to me still slung across his shoulder. 

“He’s fine” shaking me as if to show how proud he was of his accomplishment. 

“Speak for yourself” I muttered. “I feel like I’ve spent the past 24 hours at a Chukie Cheese as the only adult on duty”.

“That bad huh? Give it some time. You’ll mend.” Fanz smiled and nodded to the van. “Lets go”.

With that, Kyle threw me into the van and the next moment the facility and it’s screaming sirens were merely a dot in the rear view mirror. 

To where I didn’t know, but I’d re-evaluate my situation when we got there. 

Kyle and Lauren sat in the seats in front of me, her head resting against his shoulder and his hand through her hair. 

“You have some explaining to do. All of you.” I said as my finger jabbed into the shoulder of Lauren and Kyle. Then everybody in the van looked back at me. 

“Thank you.” I said while nodding and locking eyes with everybody. 

“I think.”
