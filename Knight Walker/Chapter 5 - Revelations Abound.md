# Revelations Abound
## Chapter 5

“Keep the change”. I said to the taxi cab driver as he stared at me wide eyed. The pearly whites of his teeth showed as a smile emerged. An eighty dollar tip is usually appreciated by anybody but I only had the hundred dollar bills in my pocket. Besides, if this money had been blood money I figured I could use it to brighten someone’s day. Do a little good in the world. 

“You came here? To think?” continuing his smile. 

“Yeah. What can I say? I’m just your average red blooded American male. Nothing too special about me”. I responded. I had told him a bit of an exaggeration to keep the conversation going and to see how he’d respond. Of course, I didn’t give him any details but I think I said just enough to vent a little and get a little feedback. It’s what you do on a 20 minute cab ride with a complete stranger. 

“Have fun in there and good luck” he said, smiled and nodded. After exchanging glances I exited the cab, shut the door, and in the short time it took my eyes to adjust to the sun he was gone. I looked down towards my feet and grimaced. I was still wearing my pair of house slippers, cargo shorts and my favorite hoodie. Lets be real for just a minute, by house slippers, I really meant Crocs. 

I know. I know. 

I lifted my arm to give my armpit a quick whiff and my nose sent a signal to my brain of intense dissatisfaction. I wouldn’t be winning any supermodel contests today. Although I know a guy. 

I sighed. Some guys have all the luck. 

I really didn’t want to be here dressed like this. Hell, I didn’t want to be caught in public like this but c'est la vie. My belly rumbled with approval, my mouth watering and I wiped my mouth free of the drool that had accumulated.

The large neon signed beckoned me in, as if I were a long lost son who finally found his way home. 

Panda Express is pretty therapeutic for me. It would seem all of the large choices I’ve needed to make in my life have been in front of a big bowl of orange chicken and a fortune cookie. I had decided to come here immediately after my run in with Franky and McCarthy to think for a bit. I had quickly realized I only had a few breadsticks and was starving. The thoughts of immediately going home crossed my mind as well but those were quickly dismissed. I wasn’t quite sure what was going to be waiting for me at home. I wasn’t sure who would be watching my place and I wasn’t really sure if my place was under surveillance. 

This location was only a mile or two away from home so I’d simply walk home from there. This would allow me the opportunity to look around my neighborhood and see what was happening without walking right into the hornets nest. I just need a moment to clear my mind. 

“You’re in the system now that we’ve located you.” Franky’s voice rang in my head and a quick shiver ran down my spine. I had so many questions. How did Franky know what had happened to me? What system was I a part of now? What was so special about the chemo I was given as a child? 

With my meal finished I unwrapped my fortune cookie praying there would be a fortune inside. Everybody knows, no fortune in a fortune cookie means really bad luck and given the way the day was going, I could use a little on my side. Cracking the cookie in half, my heart leapt a little and then out snuck my fortune.

“Revelations abound” it read. “Make your own luck” were words printed on the back. 

Most of the time, fortune cookies are just silly platitudes. I’ve even had fortunes contain phrases or “fortunes” that were guaranteed to happen. “Continue breathing”. “Enjoy life”. “You are a good person”. I try to dismiss them but this time I had one that made me think. Perhaps I _would_ find answers, perhaps I would get some clues to my past. 

Walking home I made a mental todo list of things I needed to do.  Things I needed to look up. The chemo I was given, the doctors involved, the military base where I was treated. There were so many things that could provide answers or at the very least leads to further findings. 

Approaching my neighborhood there wasn’t a whole lot of activity that raised any red flags for me. Neighbors were out potting some plants, another neighbor cleaning his garage. Wendy. Of course she was sitting on her patio. As soon I approached I saw her phone lift, she entered what appeared to be a quick text message and then her phone lowered. Her gaze immediately upon me. 

“Hi Wendy” I said waiving to her as I passed. The tone was that of a child being forced to apologize by his parents. I wasn’t too happy to see her nor was she too happy to see me. Opening the door to my house I slowly backed in. Closed the door and looked around. 

The house was exactly how I had left it so I could tell Franky’s goons hadn’t been here yet. My jeep was still out back, broken windshield and all. Noticing my garage door was still opened I closed it and prepared myself for the work that needed to be done. First things first. I needed a shower. I wanted a shower. 

Turning the faucet to hot, I let the water run for a bit. When steam started to rise I disrobed and stepped into the shower. Standing there with my hand against the wall letting the water pour over me thoughts came and went. 

“Revelations abound eh?” I said aloud to myself. Chuckling a bit. “Well lets hope it hits me in the head so I don’t have to go looking too hard for it.”

Adrenaline pulsating through my body, I was ready for answers. I wasn’t sure what I would find but I was certain I’d find something. I needed to brush my teeth though. Brushing ones teeth in the shower is akin to hot socks out of the dryer, or finding 20 bucks in your pocket when you weren’t expecting it or seeing a full tank of gas when you thought for sure you’d be on `empty`. It’s amazing and I’d highly recommend it. 

I looked around for my toothbrush. For some odd reason it wasn’t in my usual spot which was placed on my shower rack. Perhaps I had left it on the counter top? I grabbed the shower curtain to open it and stepped out searching for my toothbrush. My left foot hitting tile flooring and then lifting my right to join it on solid footing. Something I had done on a daily basis for the past 30 plus years of my life with little fanfare. 

Except the next thing I knew my legs were level with my head, and in slow motion I felt my body falling backwards. The back of my head hit the soap holder and in an instance a flash of pain echo’d throughout my body. I just sat there for a second. I typically do when I fall, making sure I know what zip code I’m in, making sure nothing was broke and then usually I’ll cuss aloud to myself for being so foolish. Not this time though. Laying in the shower motionless, the water still pouring down, I looked around. I was in quite a bit of pain and I tried to move but it was just too nauseating. Opening my eyes hurt. Every heart beat hurt. Everything hurt. My neck, my back, my head. My head. 

Did I mention my head?

The pain in my head was unbearable. I could feel it throb with every breathe and with ever heartbeat. So I did what I do best and just laid there as if waiting for my alarm clock to ring so I could violently smash the snooze button. Unable to move, unable to really see I just laid there. In the shower. 

Alone.

Being alone for me is a blessing and a curse. Ask me twenty minutes ago? I would’ve said that I loved my own company, and I love that the only problems I have to deal with were my own. No drama, no baggage. Just me. Me, myself and I. As I laid there though, I couldn’t help but think how being alone was terrible. Why didn’t I let anybody else into my life? Surely I am being so selfish?! I mean, I am keeping my awesome self to myself which seems like a complete waste of awesome. My mind continued to wander for a bit.

Then I thought of death and dying alone. More shivers ran down my spine. 

“Not now Alex” I mumbled incoherently under my breathe. “Bigger fish to fry.” I moved my hand to the back of my head and felt a large gash where my head met the porcelain soap holder. No hair, just smooth warm … bone. I had never really felt the underside of my own flesh before, and not only had I felt it, I felt what could only be described as the back of my skull. With that thought and the darkness now coming over me I closed my eyes and slipped into unconsciousness. 

I’m not entirely too sure when I came back to consciousness, but I had a feeling it hadn’t been too long. The water was still running but what was once a steaming hot shower turned into an ice bath. So perhaps I was out for a couple hours?

The blood from the tub was gone, washed away by the running water coming from the shower head. There was a bit of blood splattered on the white shower curtain. I shut off the water and looked around. For having just hit my head, and for being unconscious for what had to have been an hour or so, I felt fine. No headache, no cloudiness in my vision. Nothing. I reached behind my head wondering if the damage was as bad as I remembered, and thinking about where the nearest hospital was to get my wound stitched up. 

There was nothing. No gash, no cut. No wound. I grabbed a mirror and looked the back of my head but there wasn’t anything showing I had been injured. I just sat there staring at my shower curtain where blood was splattered. There was absolutely no way I had just imagined that. None. 

No way I imagined that and yet it was as if nothing had ever happened besides a few sprinkles of blood here and there. Unlike the nile river of blood that had been running just a few moments ago.   

My doorbell rang. 

I grabbed some fresh clothes and scrambled to put them on. All the while shouting “Just a minute!” as I hurried downstairs. 

“10 bloody seconds. 10 seconds to evaluate what in the hell is going on with my life. That’s all I need. 10 bloody seconds!” I screamed aloud to no one in particular. 

Reaching the door and opening it far too hastily I saw two men wearing black suits. The same attire I had seen at Franky’s restaurant. The larger man I recognized as the one that kept me seated for the duration and the smaller man I hadn’t recognized, but I had to guess he was also part of Franky’s goon squad. Both were carrying guns not quite concealed by their shoulder holsters, both wearing black Top Gun glasses and both wearing communication devices attached to their ear and their walkie talkies. 

Not this. Not now. I had too many things to do. 

In my most condescending, I’m talking to you like I would a dog, high pitched voice I said “Awww, look at how adorable you two are but I don’t want any girl scout cookies. Thank you ladies” and slammed the door in their face. 

By the time the door was halfway closed the larger of the two men, palm outreached, stopped the door from closing as if he were swatting a bug out of midair. 

“Alex … Alex. Why so rude to your guests? Why not let us in?” The larger man said, as he looked down at me with his glasses barely hanging on to his nose. “The quicker you let us in and out, the quicker we leave. Alright? 

Look, we don’t want to be here either. Quite frankly your neighbor is giving me the heebie jeebies.” as he stared across the way to Wendy’s porch. She was on her porch knitting and listening to the radio, but when the two men in suits looked her direction she licked her lips. 

“Ugh”. I heard them moan in unison, and they came in. 

“What do you guys want?” I said. 

“Franky wants us to just take a look around. See what makes sense and doesn’t for installing a surveillance system here. We need to get dimensions of each room for it too.” The smaller, younger man said as they both pulled out their tape measures. 

“And who are you?” Pointing to him. “I know he’s Franky’s goon, I saw him at the restaurant, but you? Who are you?” I said, gesturing back and fourth between the two goons. 

“Fanz” he said as he pulled open his sport coat to reveal a name tag. It was a dark gold with black lettering like the ones issued when entering the military. “Fanz” it read.

“Your joking? You’re ‘The Fonz’?” I quipped.

“No man! FAAAAAAAAAAAAANZ” he said as if to accentuate the A’s. “Not FOOOOOOOONZ. FAAAAANZ. What can I say. My parents have a terrible sense of humor”. 

“I take it you’re not going to take no for an answer?” I asked. 

“No” again both men shouted in unison. 

“Fine. You have 10 minutes. At the end of all of this however, nothing is coming into my house, so sorry to disappoint you.”

“Don’t care” the larger man said. “When the day comes to get it installed, you’ll be someone else’s problem. Not ours.”

Sighing I turned to my couch hoping to get my laptop out to start googling. I had so much I needed to get done and so little time to do it. Glancing down at my watch it read 4pm. Only a few more hours left before 8pm. Was I still going to go? What if these people wanted to hurt me? I was contemplating the decision. I needed answers and at this point I was desperate. Perhaps I could go back to Franky and ask, but perhaps he was lying to me. He didn’t seem like a guy I wanted to be buddy buddy with. Answers would have to come in a different way and tonight could be fruitful. 

The two men were talking behind me and I heard one of the doors close. Based on the conversation that just took place I had to imagine they were going to divide and conquer so they could get on with their days as soon as possible. I got the impression neither wanted to be there and measuring my house for dimensions was mundane work for them.

“Psssst”. I heard. Pulling my laptop out of my case. I thought perhaps it was the velcro snapping apart, or perhaps it was just my imagine but I heard it again. 

“Passst … Alex, you get the brick?”

I turned around and saw Fanz looking at me. When I went to look at him, he quickly was looking around and over his shoulder and then back to me. “Did you get the brick?”. 

I nodded. Slowly. Eyes wide open in disbelief. “Go on” I was thinking internally.

“Good good” he whispered, “We want to help. We don’t have much time. Oompa Loompa will be back any second and there is a third party at play here. Hence the brick. Couldn’t be obvious we were trying to communicate with you”.

“Shhhhh!” I half screamed, half whispered looking around as if someone were listening. “I think my house is bugged”. The thought of grabbing a baseball bat and going to town on this guy had crossed my mind but that wouldn’t accomplish anything. Besides, he clearly knew something if he was the one who put the brick through my window. But what did he know exactly? I tried my best to keep my cool, but my temper was beginning to turn angry and impatient.

“It’s not … I just checked this place two da…” and Franz tailed off as I gave him a death glare.

“You WHAT!?” again half screaming half whispering. Fury now incapacitating the portion of my brain that handles my voice of reason. This man threw a brick through my windshield, albeit he did wrap a few hundred bucks to compensate, and he had been in my house at least a few days ago. 

So many thoughts swirling in my head but that did explain why my door was left opened just a few days ago. I came home to find my deadbolt locked and my door opened. Apparently the deadbolt was keeping the door from closing, or at least that’s what I convinced myself into thinking when I got home from work to see my front door wide open. But, I just _knew_ I had closed it. 

“Sorry Alex, not important right now. There is a third party at play here but we’re not sure who. Franky. The Government. Mystery woman behind door number three. Who knows. Maybe more.” Franz said franticly. 

“Who are you? What do you want?”. Panic, confusing and anger coming into my voice. 

“R.A.S. We think you’re the key. Now Freddy is on to you”. 

“R.A.S?” I replied tilting my head to one side. The acronyms were going through my head and I couldn’t come up with anything. 

“Revelations Abound Society” Fanz responded. 

A heartbeat passed and I realized I had heard of it. Not even a few hours ago. In my fortune cookie. 

“My fortune cookie?!” I said, my voice rising.
 
Fanz winked at me. “We’re everywhere”. 

Then he reached in his coat pocket as if to grab his gun. Not quite sure what had just come over me but I felt like I needed to act. I instinctively grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt and threw him against the wall. A large thud echo’d across the house and I held him there. Teeth bared. 

“Oh no! Now he’s going to be coming back and see what all the commotion is about! We don’t have much time!” Fanz moaned. 

The hallway door opened and Fanz’s colleague walked in. His gun drawn and pointed at me. 

“Fanz, what the hell is going on here?” He said looking at Fanz and then back to me then back to Fanz again.

“Just a small misunderstanding is all Mario. Put your gun away. Please?” 

Mario looked at me. Then at Fanz. Then back at me. With a quick motion of his head, he mimed to me I should probably lower Fanz. I didn’t realize it but I had him lifted off the ground and on the wall. Looking at Fanz, he had fetched out of his pocket what he had apparently been scrambling for the entire time. 

“He …” I said, looking at Mario and pointing to Fanz, “He just said” and with that I saw a shimmer of light reflect off the object Fanz had reached for. 

A silver pen. A nice one too. One you’d find in a CEO’s office or perhaps one that could be used to sign peace treaties. Fanz unscrewed the cap to the pen and then looked at me, sighed, and closed his eyes. All within the matter of an instance. 

A very faint pop like sound came from the pen. I looked at Fanz who appeared to still had his eyes closed and then down to the floor. Mario laid motionless with dart syringe like object sticking out of his neck. 

“What the …” I said before being cut off by Fanz. 

“Cool eh? I made it in the lab. This is the 10th revision of it. Works like a charm on non human test subjects. I’ve been wanting to try it out on someone but I haven’t had the chance. I had hoped it would’ve been in a safe environment in case anything should go wrong but given the circumstance this will have to suffice. Hopefully he’ll be ok.” as he looked down at Mario. Then back to me. Then to his pen. A smile beaming across his face with the look of satisfaction and accomplishment. 

He straightened his sport coat and shirt. 

“Take this. 3 more rounds left. Should incapacitate your target for up to 10 minutes. Enough time for you to get away from a sticky situation.” Fanz said pointing to a button the side of the pen. “This activates the mechanism, this button fires it.”. He put the cap back onto the pen and shoved it in my chest. “I’m going to let the elders know you’re alive and that you’ll be there tonight. Please be there tonight. You’re the key to all of this.” and with that Fanz ran to the front door.

“Make up a story for me. He won’t know what happened, but he can’t know I was here. He can’t know I’m a part of R.A.S. or it will blow our cover. The world is no longer safe. For you. For me. For anybody. 8pm tonight. Be there or be square. Please. Just trust me.”

And with that my door opened and closed. 

Fanz was gone. 

There was an incapacitated man on my floor. A very large incapacitated man on the floor. A very large incapacitated man on the floor who had a gun. One who would be really really angry if I couldn’t come up with a good story in the next five minutes as to why he had a syringe sticking out of his neck and why he might not remembered the past few minutes. 

A moment later the whole world went silent for me. As if putting on a pair of noise cancelling head phones. Every sense of mine was incredibly heightened. I could smell the sweat from Mario as he laid motionless on the floor. I could see every pore on his face as if I were looking at him through a microscope. Every hair on my body registered feedback to my brain individually as breathe slowly washed across the surface of my skin. 

The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and my skin suddenly produced goosebumps. 

“Yup. Yup. He just left. Ran out the front door”. I heard an older woman saying.

Wendy? 

But that couldn’t be. She was across the street. I looked outside to see my neighbor on her phone getting to her feet. As she hung up she walked inside and before her door closed I could hear and see the local news playing as if my own TV were on. 

This … this isn’t possible. How? The smell. But how? How is it I can hear and see her TV from my house? As if it were in my own?

“Local kingpin Franky Lombardi kidnapped and held at ransom. Officer McCarthy found dead in his apartment. Tonight at 9 o’clock news.”

Like I was saying. Some guys have all the luck.
