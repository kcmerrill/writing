# Stranger & Stranger
## Chapter 3

A car alarm going off during the day is no big deal. A car alarm going off at 4am inhales vigorously. 

Laying there in my bed, car horn blaring and now wide awake, I was waiting for one of my neighbors to realize it was there car and to quickly turn it off. My bed was far too comfy to be interrupted and besides, I had to be to work in another 5 hours and I needed my beauty sleep. 

Fine fine. I’ll look out my window, realize it’s not my car and moan to myself about how irresponsible people are, how inconsiderate people are of one another and then star at my ceiling for another few hours before falling asleep a minute or two before my alarm clock is scheduled to go off.

Whipping the covers off my bed I rolled to the right like I normally do and my feet dove instinctively to where my bedside slippers have always been. My eyes still groggy and not quite fully alert. At this point I was going through the motions, as if I’d gotten out of my bed like a pro a thousand times before. I had by the way. Like a pro. I yawned and the thought of slipping back into my bed was so incredibly hard to resist. Slippers, right, I need my slippers. I reached around with my toes only to find my slippers weren’t there.

Odd. 

The sleep still in my eyes was thick. I rubbed at them for a bit and when I opened them I was staring at my wall. I did a double take because normally at this point in my ritual I’d be staring at my window. 

Where the hell did my window go? 

Sudden panic washed over me and I had spun around to get a better glimpse of my surroundings. My window was on the opposite wall. As was my night stand, as was my dresser, all of my shelves and posters on the wall. It was all there, it was just not where I left it the night before. Everything had been completely re-arranged. Everything. Cleaned too. Vacuumed, dusted you name it. 

I scrambled to pull my blinds open and peered outside my window. Looking down at the driveway I could see my Jeep. With its hazards flashing. Horn honking. 

I let out a long sigh. “Lovely”. I muttered to myself. I honestly didn’t even know my car had an alarm so I’m glad I checked. The top and the doors were off, leaving it just 4 wheels, a few dirty seats and a whole lot of fun. Except now it was a whole lot of windshield less fun. 

Someone busted out my windshield. Tiny bits of glass fragments laid all over the hood, seats and dash. “Just my luck” I said to no one aloud. No doors and no top and outside in the middle of the night there wasn’t anything inside for anybody to steal. Probably just a punk kid wanting to ruin my day. Mission accomplished. I’ve had a few windows broken in my vehicles in the past and it’s always been a minor inconvenience but luckily nobody seemed hurt and it’s nothing a little insurance and a quick appointment can’t fix.

Realizing my horn and lights were still screaming at the top of their lungs in the middle of the night I grabbed a pair of shorts that were left laying on the floor, something I vividly remember doing last night, and went to put them on. Making a beeline for the door I felt excruciating pain shooting through my left thigh. Like a sprinter pulling his muscle halfway through a race, I must’ve pulled mine putting on my shorts. What can I say? I’m a thoroughbred. A trained professional athlete in top peak physical condition. That’s actually not true, and I probably did pull my muscle putting on my shorts if that tells you anything about my physique. 

I hobbled down the stairwell two steps at a time and fumbled for my keys. I found them, pressed the disarm button as a little weight had been lifted off my shoulders immediately. A little apprehension came over me when I saw Wendy, my neighbors light flicker on. 

Wendy loved to sit on her patio and gossip. She had hated me from the day I moved in. Probably because I didn’t introduce myself on the first day, or within the first year for that matter. I’m an introvert and like to keep to myself and sure, I’ll wave when I see them but I don’t go out of my way to be Mr. Rogers friendly to anybody. Preferring to live and let live I keep my head low and keep to myself. 

I too turned on my living room light. My hope was I could pretend that I just woke up too after the alarm had been turned off and if she caught me all sleepy eyed and weary we could exchange glances as if to say to each other “Yeah, it woke me up too, what a jerk whomever that was.”. That didn’t happen because I was too busy not recognizing the placement of my living room furniture. It too had been re-arranged. Cleaned even. 

“Wow, nice! I can’t believe this is _my_ place!” I thought to myself. 

My stairs and carpets had all ben vacuumed, my dishes put away, all of my shelves were dust free and the hundreds of finger prints on my flat screen TV were all removed leaving a shiny, almost brand new looking tv in its place. Of course, the biggest change had been the new layout of my furniture as everything had simply changed positions.

Briefly panicked I sat down on my couch and just looked around and started to breathe long slow breathes. There was nothing that I could do now that it was already done. I shook my head and wondered what life would be like if I were someone else. If I had been dealt a different hand of cards. I’d been here many times before and it never makes the realization any easier. 

I had done all of this in my sleep. Again. For perhaps the thousandth time. 

Believe it or not this is actually one of the perks to having REM sleep disorder. Things just magically happen, both good and bad in the middle of the night while I’m asleep. I have no recollection of what I did in the night and I’m not aware I’m doing anything as I’m doing it. I just wish I could do something more productive like work out for 9 hours and not realize it you know? Im always tired too. Between working full time, trying to enjoy life and my own personal interior decorating service there leaves very little time for sleep apparently. 

It’s been this way for years. Slowly and progressively getting worse just like my childhood oncologist told me it would. We had this conversation after she had found me outside the hospital sitting on the curb with my chemo drip bag at my side. Apparently I had hauled it along with me and apparently nobody stopped to think about letting a 10 year outside. I’ve always wondered how that could happen but I suppose it would make sense. There are typically far fewer nurses at night then at other times throughout the day and I knew she would stay later than most given her line of work.

“What are you doing outside Alex? With your IV no less?”

“I dunno ma’am. I just ended up outside. I woke up and here we are”. I felt really embarrassed and ashamed so I stared at my feet which were bare and dirty. “I didn’t mean for this to happen, honest”.

“I know.” she replied. “I figured I’d ask but I already knew the answer. Just wanted confirmation. I’ve seen you sleep walk like this many times. This is just one of the many side effects to your chemo and radiation. 

Alex, doctors will tell you this is REM sleep disorder. You’ll do things in your sleep that may or may not mirror what happens in your dreams. You’ll do things, say things that don’t make any sense when you wake up but I’m sure will make sense to you when you’re doing them.

Don’t be embarrassed or ashamed though. This is who you are and it’s not your fault.

Do me a favor? Promise?”

I remember sobbing uncontrollably for a few minutes before responding.

“Ok. Sure”. 

“I want you to sleep in a sleeping bag from now on. It’ll make it harder for you to get up and walk around. It sounds crazy I know, but that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sleeping bag you have, I want you to use it every night ok?”

So I did. I used that damn sleeping bag every night for years on end until I just felt like I didn’t need it anymore. A few years had lapsed before it started to rage up again. It didn’t really get going again until I went off to college. It would be little stupid things at first. I’d wake up wrestling lamps. Hehe, it sounds crazy to think about but hey, this is my life as I know it. Mundane, remember? 

In college my roommates would place bets on what I’d have dreams on, a lot of the cleaning would get done, furniture would get re-arranged, and more lamps would have to get wrestled. 

I once saved my then girlfriend at the time from a lava flow. Of course it was in my dream so I thought I was being all heroic. I  of course wasn’t, if anything I just made the situation exponentially worse for our relationship. I wasn’t suppose to be at her place to begin with as her ultra conservative parents hated me. They hated everybody, but they definitely hated me. We had a this really brilliant idea that I’d sneak into her bedroom at midnight, and after we, “talked” for a bit I’d sneak out. Except, I passed out like a rock only to dream of said lava flow. Both of us in our underwear I carried her away to safety which also happened to be about breakfast time in the household, and it also happened to be in her living room. The glare I received that day from her father as he slowly lowered his newspaper seeing me in my boxers holding his daughter in her underwear with a very panicked look on her face still haunts me to this day. 

Crazy things still happen from time to time but mainly it’s just walking around and re-arranging furniture. I’ve spent a lot of time researching it but one thing I never figured out is what actually causes it. I was told by my oncologist that it was due to chemo and radiation, which would make sense given just how crazy chemo and radiation are to a human body, except for the fact that there has been no scientific evidence of such relation.

Something else was causing this but I don’t know what. 

I stood up from my couch still wondering what had happened to my car. When things like this happen I typically hold my breathe and hope it wasn’t anything I had done during the middle of the night. I grabbed a hoodie, opened my garage door and navigated my way through the boxes and piles of junk my garage had accumulated since moving in. 

Sure enough there was a brick on my driver side floorboard. Upon further inspection, it had what appeared to be a piece of paper wrapped tightly by string around it. I tugged at the string to loosen it and within a few seconds it became loose and the piece of paper fell to the ground. Along with 3 one hundred dollar bills. 

Snatching the money out of the air as if I were in a money booth, my mind was going at a million miles a minute. On one hand I was happy. Who doesn’t like free money? On the other I was even happier if that was at all possible because I don’t carry money which meant that I wasn’t stupid enough to throw a brick through my windshield in my sleep. On the other hand there was a slow rage building up inside of me. They could’ve just left the brick on my floorboard. It’s not as if there were doors or a top to stop them. 

I began to open the note to see what could possibly be written in it when a cop siren had gone off. Looking up I could see an officer in his car with both red and lights flashing and the occasional siren. He pulled up next to my Jeep, lights still flashing and looked at me. 

“Are you the owner of this property” he asked in a very southernly drawl. He was a tall man of average build. He looked like he had seen a lot of shit in his day and I was just one more punk middle aged man in his way.

“I am”. As I looked at his badge and it read ‘McCarthy’. “Officer McCarthy”. 

“We got a call from one of the neighbors saying they heard a loud noise about a half hour ago at this address. Would you know anything about this disruption of the peace son?” he asked. 

As I looked at my shattered windshield in a million and one pieces, I responded.

“I woke up to find a brick through my windshield and my car alarm disrupting the peace, does that count?” 

“A car alarm you say? What is that in your hand?” McCarthy asked. 

“It’s the brick I found through my windshield. Given my doors were off along with the top I figured some punk kid was out to ruin my day”. 

“That’s interesting son, can I see it?” he drawled. 

The money was already in my pocket and I went to put the note in as well for safe keeping. I got a firm grip on the brick and passed it over to officer McCarthy. As my arm was outstretched he took a look at my hand grabbed the brick. He cocked his head to the side, as if pondering the meaning of life. I too looked a little puzzled and looked down at my hand. 

Oh no. I saw it too. 

I don’t know how or why but there was blood under all of my fingernails. McCarthy focused in on it too and without warning or pause whipped me around and shoved my arm up so high I thought he’d break my arm at my shoulder blade. 

The sound of handcuffs clicked and the cold steel pressed against my wrist. He grabbed my other hand and in a moments time it too was surrounded by cold steel. I was in too much shock to do anything about it. Not that I would as I hear resisting arrest is not a smart move. 

“Office McCarthy” I said, my words stuttering out of my mouth with pure nervousness. “What’s going on? Am I under arrest?”

“Nah boy” he quipped. “I just thought you might need to scratch the top of your head. Being as polite as I am, I thought I’d help you out some. 

Of course you’re under arrest.”

He moved me over to the backseat of his police cruiser and opened the door. Put his hand on my head and pushed me down careful not to bang my head against the roof of the car. I swung my legs inside and just sat there in disbelief. 

How the heck did blood get under my fingernails? What exactly was the call about? What was the noise my neighbors heard? 

About a half hour had passed and officer McCarthy came back to the car door where I was situated. I noticed while I was waiting another cop had pulled up next to my house and out came a small female figure holding a piece of paper. She handed it to officer McCarthy. Giving it a few glances he looked it up and down and then to me. 

He began to slowly walk to where I was seated.

“Alex is it?” he asked. 

“Yes sir”. 

“Normally in a situation like this I gotta fill out a bunch of bullshit paperwork to get a warrant to search your house but you look scared out your damn mind which leads me to believe you’re either innocent or hiding something. Ya dig?”

“Yes sir … I mean, no sir, I’m not hiding anything from you. I don’t know what’s going on. Whatever I can do to clear the air let me know and I’m happy to do it.”. My words came out incredibly fast, like a garden hose that had been pinched for far too long. 

“Alright son, tell me, whose blood is under your fingernails there and why. Can we go look through your house with your permission to see if we can’t clear all of this up?”

“What”. It’s a four letter word but given how badly I was mumbling it was drawn out for a while. 

“Whose blood is under your fingernails son?” McCarthy said again with a bit of impatience in his voice. 

“I … I don’t know.” I mumbled. “I have a sleeping problem where I do random things in my sleep. I swear. Nobody lives with me. It’s just me. I swear. I don’t know if it’s even blood or not.”

“You mean to sit here and tell me that you do random shit in your sleep boy? That your neighbor swears they heard someone scream bloody murder and you don’t have a damn clue as to what is going on?” McCarthy asked. 

“McCarthy!” the female officer yelled. She was across the street with a congregation of neighbors. Wendy was one of them along with a few other random people I’d seen before in my neighborhood. 

Officer McCarthy got up and pulled out a notebook from his front breast pocket and began to scribe some notes down as he walked over to the female officer and the crowd of people that had been gathered. 

The group was quite a ways away. I would’ve given anything to have been a fly on the wall during that conversation but they were just too far away. I closed my eyes and rested my head against the police cruisers seat. 

“Oh he’s a quiet guy.” I heard a low, almost whispering voice continue on.

“He is quiet but he’s weird. You know, I once saw him walking around the neighborhood in his boxers checking his mail. Well after midnight. Can you believe that? I found him just standing and staring at the mailbox for about five minutes before he did anything. Looking at it as if he didn’t even know what it was.”

The voice sounded like Wendy’s but it was impossible. The group was just too far away and as much as I wanted to hear what was going on, it was impossible. Perhaps I was imagining what she was saying. Perhaps. I dunno. This was just a crazy morning to say the least. Maybe it’s stress causing me to hear things. 

I opened my eyes looking over at the group where officer McCarthy was busy taking notes. Where Wendy was speaking. 

“It’s a mailbox honey. That’s what it is. Nothing special, now get some damn clothes on and go home” she continued. 

“He never waves hello to any of us, he just goes on about his day like none of us are there. I get so mad” Wendy went on. 

My eyes were wide. My jaw to the floor. How was it possible that I could hear their conversation? Was I imagining this? Was it true? My mind said it wasn’t true but all of Wendy’s body language and gestures all lined up with what I thought I was hearing. 

Wendy went on for another few minutes while McCarthy scribbled more and more notes. 

“And it sounded like there was a woman up there too, but there most definitely wasn’t! He never brings home women. He’s a loser, a loaner. No woman would want that. Right? Why would anybody want that.”. 

I’m not entirely sure what is happening. How could this be? I closed my eyes and tried to clear my mind resting my head once again on the back seat. I was hoping this would all end soon. Surely everybody would agree this was a misunderstanding.  

The conversation continued and abruptly officer McCarthy began to jog my way. He looked down at my feet making sure they were in the car and slammed the door shut, hoped in, and began to drive away from my house. 

Fast. Almost too fast. 

“Yeah, you there? 
…
He’s in my backseat.” I heard him say into his phone. 

“Officer? What’s going on?” I said, or screamed. I’m not sure which because of how scared I was. 

He looked in the rear view mirror with his phone pressed against his ear and with his right elbow smacked into the rear wire fence separating the driver and passenger compartments a few times violently. 

“SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH BOY” he screamed. Phone still firmly pressed to his head. 

“No. 10 thousand dollars. That’s what we agreed to dammit.
…
Well I’ll drop his ass off in a damn field somewhere. Let the buzzards get ‘em.
…
I don’t give a damn. 10 thousand you hear?
…
Alright. Be there in 5.”
