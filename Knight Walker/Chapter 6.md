# My camping spot
## Chapter 6

Tick tock. Tick tock. 

The clock was ticking. It was so incredibly loud in my ears even though it was across the room. 

Tick tock. Tick tock. 

The clock continued to pound my head with how loud it was. Even after multiple attempts to plea for more time, the clock kept ticking. I guess that’s life. Moving on with or without you. 

“Geez… what is happening to me?” I mumbled under my breathe. 

Not a moment later the sound of a freight train running through my townhouse brought me to my knees. My head was pounding, it was so loud but it wasn’t a train, just the furnace turning on accounting for the door being left open in the cool autumn air. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why everything was so loud. As if my hearing intensified 100x. 

Mario still laid on the ground motionless except for a few twitches here and there. If Fanz was right, I only had 9 minutes left before I had to act. I couldn’t think, like a child hitting me on the head repeatedly with a bat while trying to taking an exam, there was no way to think. Only pain, nausea too. 

I had a few options though. I could lie to Mario and come up with some story as to how he had a needle sticking from his neck and how Fanz went to chase down the culprit. I could grab my bug out bag and just leave. Get away for a few days and just leave him there. I could do both even. 

As the options raced through my mind I decided. I’ll come up with a story when Mario comes back to consciousness, clear up the mess that Fanz had made so his cover wasn’t blown and then grab my gear and just head for the mountains. I know a quiet spot and my bug out bag has enough gear in it for at least a few days. Ultimately I felt the quiet would do me some good. Getting away and scrutinizing everything over the past day would do some some good. Being away from everything and everyone that was trying to do harm to me would do me some good.

I collected my gear. Sleeping bag, food, stove, tent and water. All where I last left it in case of an emergency. I tossed my pack in the back of the jeep and using a tire iron removed and vacuumed the rest of the glass from my broken windshield. 

Hoping to cause a commotion, a very loud commotion, I bolted my deadbolt and using an axe I had on my patio for my fire pit used it to rip open my door as if to break it down, and when I felt it was soft enough to drive my foot through it kicked through it. 

Mario stirred and then finally sat up. 

It worked. 

Feeling a pain in his neck he instinctively grabbed the spot where the needle was protruding. A sharp pain echo’d throughout his body and he grabbed at the syringe ripping it from his flesh. Examining it as if he’d just swatted a bug from his neck and seeing what was remaining. Realization as to situation he was in he reached for his gun and pointed it at me. 

Throwing my hands in the air and in a calm voice I said “Easy Mario … Easy. Give me a minute to explain and then you can shoot me ok?”

In a groggy voice he said “You have 30 seconds.”

“Franky’s been kidnapped. Someone dressed in military fatigues came through the front door forcefully.” I said as Mario turned to look towards the busted up door. “Whoever it was saw me, then you and Fanz, must have panicked and then shot.” I said, using my eyes to point to the syringe now laying on the floor. “Given it’s my house it was probably meant for me. Fanz seemed to think it was a sedative used to help get me in the getaway car without too much trouble.”

Mario lowered his gun only slightly. “So where is Fanz?”

I exhaled slowly. It seemed that Mario was believing my story. The realization of it working I immediately continued on.

“Fanz took the car and followed them out of the complex. I don’t know where they went but Fanz said to get back and alert the others.”

Mario lowered his weapon and slowly wobbled to his feet. Clearly groggy and suffering from vertigo by standing too quickly. Before he fell over, I reached for his arm and led him to the jeep. 

“I’ll take you back to Little Italy’s or wherever you need to get to.” I said as I helped him inside.

He didn’t say anything. Clearly still suffering from whatever it was Fanz shot at him but it was clearly working. He was easily persuaded and I’m sure if I asked him to walk off a cliff he would’ve. I didn’t want to push it though. I just wanted to drop him off and get out of dodge. 

Ten or so minutes passed and we were nearing Little Italy’s. We stopped at a intersection and Mario mumbled under his breathe. 

“What? I didn’t get that”. I asked. 

“Here is fine. Drop me off here.” Mario said still mumbling. 

“Ok.”

A moment later in my rear view mirror I saw Mario walking. Headed towards the restaurant. I didn’t know where or what he was going to do but at this point I didn’t care. I was cleared of the next hurdle and I needed to get going before the sunlight was gone for the night. 

It’s only an hour and a half from my house to my favorite camping spot trailhead. It’s in the middle of nowhere on the Colorado Trail and the awesome thing is, depending on your mood, energy levels and amount of people in the area you can setup your camping spot within 10 minutes, or hike in a few hundred miles to avoid people. 

Getting away from people was my main objective so I hiked for a few hours to my favorite spot. It’s secluded with no people usually, even on the busiest of holidays, with a river flowing through the campsite. This was important to me as I didn’t really know how long I’d be out there and water was important. 

It was chilly but not cold as I pulled on light jacket. The sun was setting but it wasn’t completely dark out. Most people would  have felt a bit uncomfortable in this situation but I’ve done this a thousand times. Literally. Over the years I’ve camped in numerous sites but for some reason I’ve always gravitated to this one. 

For no particular reason aside from the checkboxes that this particular spot checked. It was a few miles on the trail so it was a great workout. It had a river going through it that provided water and wild game in case things got hairy, it was completely secluded by trees and off the beaten path and it had a ton of firewood in case the nights got too cold which they often did. For 15 years I’ve come to the same spot and overtime I’d try going somewhere else something in side of me persuaded me not to. Perhaps it was my lack of courage to try new adventures, or perhaps it was just a little voice inside of me begging me to change my mind. 

Either way, this wasn’t my first trip here and I was hopeful that it wouldn’t be my last. 

I setup shop just as the sun set. 

“In the nick of time” I said aloud to no one but myself. I was in the middle of nowhere. Nobody knew who I was out here, and luckily I hadn’t seen anybody on my 2 hour long hike in. It was just me and the boonies and I was looking forward to food and sleep. Most definitely sleep. 

I had a nice little fire going with a few cups of water boiling for my meal. 

Top ramen. 

What can I say? I’m a master chef. 

Luckily for me the world had quieted down. The intensified hearing I was experiencing early in the day subsided and I was feeling back to normal. A nice hot meal tends to right all the wrongs in the world. If even for a few minutes. 

As I slurped down the final bits of my ramen, and began to organize my sleeping bag when I heard the nearest tree come alive. What appeared to be a thousand crows left the tree at once in a panic and what little light was left in the sky was now obstructed by black of the crows flying overhead. 

Odd. My mind racing of weird and strange occurrences that have happened to me over the years. 

I slowly climbed into my sleeping bag and bivy. I jokingly call it the bear burrito. Basically, it’s a sophisticated trash bag that you can take with you in order to protect yourself from the elements without needing an actual tent. It’s called a bear burrito because if a bear wanders through your camp while you’re in it, there is no quick way of escaping and you’d make an easy meal for a bear. Luckily I’ve never experienced a bear sighting before from within a sleeping bag. 

I once went camping, one of my first few times out many years ago, when something was crawling through my campsite. I only knew it was crawling through my campsite because I heard the rustling through the trees and then eventually heard the sounds of claws scraping across the hood of my jeep. A slight terror came across me and I quickly went through all of the training and preparation that came to mind mind when it happened. 

I screamed. Loudly and in the highest pitches possible. In pure fear I reached for my jeep keys and did the only thing I could think of at the time and hit the panic button. The problem with hitting the panic button, while the critter quickly left the campsite, was where I was parked. Atop a vertex of a mountain and the alarm of the jeep echo’d throughout the valley for miles on end. It was embarrassing to say the least but at least I wasn’t eaten alive in my bear burrito. To be fair, it could’ve been a raccoon. Then again, it could’ve been a bear. I suppose I’ll never know, but for the sake of telling a manly story I’d like to think it was a bear. A big ferocious man eating grizzly bear. 

I closed the zipper to my sleeping bag as the mummy style sleeping bag warmly wrapped around my face. 

Laughing to myself I recalled even more adventures from this very campsite. Waking up in the middle of the woods not knowing where or what I was doing. Waking up talking to the trees and not remembering the conversation or one time waking up freezing naked in the river. This campsite has been very special to me over the years and I’ve made a lot of memories here. 

As the fire flames slowly turned to hot ambers, the sky turned from dawn to night and the stars came out I found myself with heavy eyes. I didn’t want to fight it. It’d been a long day and for once I felt safe. The night sky this so far out is absolutely incredible. You can see the clouds of the galaxy on most nights given there is such low light pollution, and if you stare at one part of the night sky it’s inevitable you’ll see something moving across the distance. Be it a satellite, a meteorite or fecal matter burning up in the atmosphere. I realize it sounds crazy but most people think they are seeing a meteorite, and by all accounts some definitely do, but more times than not it’s simply astronaut byproducts being burned up as it enters the earth’s atmosphere.

In the morning when I would wake up, I would recount everything that happened during the day. Take inventory of what was happening and come up with a plan. For now, I would let the heaviness of my eyelids take it’s toll and fall asleep. 

I awoke not to bright sunlight but to the chill of the night air. It was pitch black as I looked around except for the limited light bouncing off the moon. Something didn’t feel right. I was out of my sleeping bag and at first glance I couldn’t see any of my camping gear nearby. 

Reaching for my head I felt my beanie as I had left it, and fixed to it was my headlamp that I quickly clicked on. Bright light instantly filled the area nearest to me and I looked around and with a gasp of realization I saw I was nowhere near where I had opened my eyes. I closed my eyes, drew in a deep breathe and relaxed. 

This wasn’t the first this has ever happened to me. Be it at home or camping. I always wake up in random places, and I’ve always found my way home. I just needed to relax and assess my situation. Looking around, my line shining on everything I quickly noticed that while I hadn’t been nice and comfy in my sleeping bag, this area was not all that unfamiliar to me. I’ve awoken here on countless nights camping and was able to quickly identify some of the trees and rocks.

I climbed to my feet, known that my sleeping bag and equipment were right over the hill to my south. I just had to take a quick 5 minute hike to get there. Then I’d go to sleep and hopefully the next time I would wake up it would be warmer with the rays of sunshine beating on my face inviting me to sleep in just a little longer. 

When I got to my feet I heard and felt something drop from my lap. Picking up the object I noticed it was a notebook that was tucked away in a waterproof airtight sealed bag. Both of which I had purchased countless years ago but had thought I lost. 

Laughing to myself and talking to no one in particular I said “How the heck did you get out here? I thought I accidentally donated you to goodwill?”

Using my had to dust the cover off I saw my name and email address on the cover in case it were ever to be lost. I do this to all my notebooks and given I thought I donated it so many years ago I just chalked it up to me being forgetful and leaving it somewhere.

I opened the cover and combed through the pages. The first few pages were lined with todo lists, a few notes on how to access some of the systems for work. As I continued flipping through the pages I noticed characters and drawings scribbled across many pages of the notebook. None of them recognizable, but most certainly in my handwriting. I have terrible but distinct handwriting. I ended up being a software engineer but my handwriting would indicate I should’ve been a doctor. 

There were graphs, drawings, formulas. On a few pages it looked to be schematics for something but I couldn’t make out what. There were dates transcribed on every page. This was my handwriting but none of my thoughts. This was without a doubt my notebook with my handwriting. But how?

The dates were mostly in the summertime and a few winter dates sprinkled in. I camped mostly in the summer time but when I would be feeling alone, mopey and just wanted to get away there were rare occasions I’d come out in the winter. I grabbed my phone and turned it on. Looking through the photos of my previous camping adventures the dates of the photos matched to those dates that were in the notebook. 

You’re probably wondering just how far in the boonies I am if I have cell phone reception. To answer that quickly, really really far. Easily an hour’s drive on a dirt road with a bit of offloading just to get to the trailhead and then easily a few hours hiking just to get to my camping spot. I’ve come here hundreds of times over the years and one of the biggest reasons is I’m on call for work. With cellphone reception there is no excuse not to go camping.

I was still half asleep, so I grabbed the waterproof bag and notebook and returned to the direction I vaguely remember my campsite being. I don’t know how to fix my sleeping issues, as they happen completely randomly. It doesn’t impact how I feel in the morning, that I know of, but it happens enough that I know just get to bed quickly and I’ll fall right back asleep. 

As I stumbled in the direction of my warm sleeping bag, and the thoughts of snuggling in for the night crept over my mind I heard a clicking noise behind me. 

I was awake now. I wasn’t imagining anything either. There as a noise coming from behind the tree. Half of me wanted to run as fast as I could and pretend I didn’t hear anything. Another part of me felt curious and wanted to investigate. Against my better judgement I opted to investigate. 

My headlamp lit my path as I walked towards the clicking noise. Pushing aside the brush I entered a large clearing with a large flat rock on the ground. In the center was an object only a foot or so tall. It was mechanical with a tripod holding it up into place. There were 3 pieces of what looked like metal in the shape of a leaf rotating around a cylinder that was emitting a low glow of light. 

As I walked closer to it, the light of the cylinder increased and as it came into view I realized it looked like a large … crystal. The object looked very rudimentary made up of pots, pans, silverware, cooking tongs, steel cleaning brushes etc … 

The leafs rotating around the crystal made it inadvisable to get too close, but I got close enough to identify the utensils. While none of them had my name on them, I immediately recognized everything on the object as having belonged to me at one point or another over the past ten or so years. All things that went missing in my house that I chalked up to accidentally throwing away when I was doing whatever it was when I was asleep.

“What … what is this?”

I opened the notebook and frantically went through all of the pages. Noticing nothing of interest until I got towards the end of the notes. I held up one of the pages as the drawing on the page looked remarkably close to what I was seeing in front of me. 

I gasped. I had no explanation for it. Was I doing this in my sleep? Was I stashing everyday household items in my camping gear, hiding it from myself when I’d sleepwalk, and then over the course of years constructed this? But how? But why? This was my notebook. These were my utensils but .. 

“I don’t understand”…

Just then the loudest bang I’d ever heard came across the night sky. I looked up to see a flash of white light and saw what appeared to be a meteorite coming down. Of course, given my condition and the day it was having it was only fitting that it was coming straight for me. I lifted my arm to shield my eyes and a feeble attempt at protecting myself and feel to my knees. 

A moment later there was another loud bang and the complete silence. 

The sky was black again. The only light coming from the moon and my headlamp. Looking around, the soft glow of the crystal that was once a dim white light now was a steady blue.

Under the illumination of the crystal I noticed something else familiar too. I reached over to grab it and the crystal turned red. 

“Ok … ok … easy … easy.” I said aloud as if talking to another being. 

I noticed though my very first smartphone was attached. The screen was completely cracked as I last remembered it being. I sat on it once and had to throw it away because it was completely useless to me at the time. Yet, here it was, attached to an object I had no idea how was built, with items that I thought I had lost long ago. 

My head throbbed again as the blood went rushing through my head. My heart was beating a million miles a minute as I heard a rumbling off in the distance. I couldn’t quite place the sound but I’ve heard it before at the airport. Or perhaps the air force base. A jet? A helicopter? A moment later I heard an ear piercing sound as I saw a rabbit snap a twig only a few feet away from me. 

“Ugh. Not this again … not now.”

My vision, my smell, my hearing. All intensified. I could hear the birds screaming in the trees. I could hear twigs snapping off in the distance as wild animals moved throughout the forest. Even ants walking across the earth seemed to be incredibly loud and painful as my mind was confused with how to handle the sensory overload I was experiencing. 

The stars came into focus and as I looked to the night sky I saw a commercial flight overhead. Usually it’s just a blinking light, but now I could visibly see the lights in the front of the aircraft, the tail and the wings. As if it were flying only a few feet away from me. 

I dropped to my knees. This was too much too soon. I had come out here hoping pick apart what was happening in my life. Not to add more confusion to it. 

Sobbing I struggled to regain my emotions and my breathe as now I was hyperventilating. 

As I lay on all fours on the ground, breathing hard, tears running from my eyes I felt a light pressure on my back. As if a hand were gently placed on my spine. It went quiet and my thoughts slowly straightened themselves out. The pounding in my head stopped, my sense of smell, my hearing, my vision all of it subdued and went back to normal. The light from my headlamp went out, the glow of the crystal turned off. As if a candle in the wind, everything just stopped. 

Collapsing to the ground, I rolled over on my back to see the person who had approached. Except it wasn’t a person. The outline of the object looked like a human except it clearly wasn’t. I could make out large black eyes and exceptionally large arms but it wasn’t a scary figure. It was a calming reassuring figure. 

Its hand rested now on my chest, it’s calming presence soothed every aching thought in my mind. 

“Be still”. A voice coming across not through my ears but through my mind. “Just be still”.

I squinted trying to get a better mental image of just what I was looking at. It was so hard to think or to see for that matter but I tried. It wasn’t anything I’d ever seen before, but I didn’t see enough to make a complete mental image. 

By the time I started to piece together everything the loud sound of engines came above the tree canopy. Bright lights shining on me and the being that was with me was gone. Completely gone. Replaced with a searchlight from 3 apache attack helicopters beamed directly on me. 

I climbed to my feet shielding my eyes with my hand, as I saw men in military fatigues dropping down from ropes coming at me. Assault rifles drawn and pointed in my direction.

One of the helicopters landed and a tall man exited the aircraft. He took a few looks around, reached to his ear, barked some orders and pointed in a few different directions. He was clearly the ring leader. 2 men came and seized the object behind me, another picked up the bag and notebook that had fallen to the floor and handed it to the ring leader. 

He walked towards me, thumbing through the notebook. 

“Alex!” He said, screaming, not at me but to be heard over the roar of the engines. “Is that you?”. 

Given there were men with assault rifles pointed at me, and given there were 3 apache helicopters, I quickly decided lying would not help me in anyway. 

“Yes. I’m Alex.” I yelled back. 

He nodded to one of the men, and just as quickly the man walked over to my direction. 

My hands were handcuffed with what looked like a low green radiant light. A potato sac was placed over my head and I was led towards the helicopter. I was pushed down into the seat and with a crack of pain and what had to be the butt end of the assault rifle over my temple, I fell unconscious. 

I awoke to hear two men talking. 

“How much blood did you take from Alex?”
